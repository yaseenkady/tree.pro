Malanoma is the most common cause of death from skin cancer.

Melanoma is characterized by the following: asymmetry, irregular borders, non-uniform color, diameter, and greater than 6mm.

Superficial spreading and lentigo maligna melanoma are radial types which grow horizontally and have lower risk of metastasis.

Nodular and acral lentiginous are vertical types which grow into dermis and have higher risk of metastasis.

Acral lentiginous type is more common in darker skin.

Depth of tumor is Breslow thickness and correlates with risk of metastasis.
