Toxo means damage.

Dogs are the definitive hosts.

Adult worms lay eggs in the dog intestine and the eggs exit via feces.

Eggs mature in the soil and become cysts.

When another dog eats the cysts, the cysts hatch in the intestine and the larva penetrates into the circulation and reaches the lung.

The larva grows further in the lung and is eventually coughed up and swallowed to return to the intestine, where the adult worms lay more eggs.

If humans eat cysts, the cysts hatch but the larva can not find the dog lung and wonder around to various tissues, causing diseases.

Toxocara cati is cat version of this worm.

15% of the US population have been infected.

Treat with albendazole while reducing inflammation with corticosteroid.
