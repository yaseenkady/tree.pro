## Summary

## Name

Taenia means flat band or tape.
Solium means seat.

## PATHOGEN

### Evolve

Worms lay eggs in humans.
Eggs exit via feces.

When a pork or human ingests an egg, the egg senses being ingested and matures into a cyst, which contains the head of a worm and disseminates throughout the body.

If a human ingests a cyst, the cyst senses being inside a human, hooks onto the intestinal wall, and matures into an adult worm, which can lay eggs and repeat the life cycle.

Humans are both definitive and intermediate hosts (configuration found only with this parasite).
Pigs are the intermediate host.

Can't and don't need to move because the pigs eat feces.

### Enter

### Colonize

Colonize intestine for years.

### Persist

### Replicate

The weak immune system in the brain allows replication inside a cyst.

Each subunit makes thousands of eggs each day.

### Exit

Humans are the deadend hosts.
Even if a pig eats an infected human (cysticercosis), cysts will not grow into a worm in the pig, because the cyst is the worm head that hooks onto the human gastrointestinal epithelium.

## IMMUNITY

### Protect

### Detect

### Deploy

Eosinophil.
IgG.

### Eliminate

### Remember

## MEDICINE

### Sign and Symptom

Taeniasis is asymptomatic.

Cysticercosis is symptomatic; dying cyst inflammation causes mass effect.
The cysts go many places and cause problems in brain (neurocysticercosis causes new onset seizure), eyes, and muscles (swelling and muscle waste).

People with Taeniasis often self innoculate and have cysticercosis.

### Diagnosis

MRI shows cysts in the brain and calcified lesions in muscles.

Muscle cysticercosis breaks down, releases antigens, and causes high eosinophil count.

### Therapy

Antiepileptic.
Glucocorticoids.
Albendazole.
Praziquantel.

### Prevention

To prevent Taeniasis:
Avoid cysts in the pork.

To prevent cysticercosis:
Avoid eggs in the human feces.

### Epidemiology

More common in populations that eat pig.
