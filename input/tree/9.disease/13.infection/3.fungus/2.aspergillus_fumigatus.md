## Summary

## Name

Aspergillus means sprinkle.
Fumigatus means to smoke.

## PATHOGEN

### Evolve

### Enter

Ubiquitous in the environment and exists as filaminitis mold form.
Like dandelion.
A person inhales thousands of spores daily.
Spore enters alveoli.

### Colonize

If the immune system is weak, germinates and grows hyphae to spread.

### Persist

### Replicate

### Exit

## IMMUNITY

### Protect

Respiratory epithelium.
Mucus.
Cilia.

### Detect

### Deploy

Innate immune system.
Respiratory macrophage.
Type 2 pneumocyte.
Neutrophil; defective neutrophil increases the susceptibility.

### Eliminate

### Remember

## MEDICINE

### Sign and Symptom

Not common in HIV.
Pulmonary aspergillus: bilateral pulmonary nodules and groud glass opacities.

People with increased alveolar space (due to emphysema especially) get slow growing, less invasive, and chronic Aspergillosis.
People with a lung cavity (due to tuberculosis) get Aspergilloma, fungal ball that does not invade (due to intact immune system) but pain and hemoptysis.
People with abundant mucus (due to asthma) can get allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, where fungi proliferate in the mucus and trigger allergic reactions.

Even if the patient with pulmonary Aspergillosis coughs, there won't be spores.
Aspergilloma produces spores but not enough to transmit to another person.

### Diagnosis

Biopsy and culture.
Bronchoscopy.
Microscope: unique fruiting bodies.

Fungal antigen: galactomannan (cell wall component) and B d glucan.

Ig serology is limited.

Radiograph.

### Therapy

Reverse neutropenia.

Antibacterial and antifungal, but limited.

Intravenous amphotericin B, which inhibits the ergosterol, but causes renal insufficiency.

Voriconazole

Echinocandin class, which inhibits the fungal cell wall, is effective too; since cell walls are not present in the human cells, this class has less toxicity.

### Prevention

Avoid dusts, construction sites, and composts.

### Epidemiology

The most common pathogen in human.
High mortality, at least 40%.
