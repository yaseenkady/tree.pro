Mite.

Itch is worse at night.

Skin-skin transmission.

Male and female mate on the skin.

Females secrete proteolytic enzymes to burrow beneath stratum corneum and lay eggs, which hatch and repeat the process.

Itch is delayed symptom because type 4 hypersensitivity reaction is a cell mediated process that takes time.

Treat all contacts.

In people with immunodeficiency and donw syndrome, cell mediated reaction is weak, so scabies profilerate a lot and causes crusted scabies, inviting other super infections.

Treat with antimicrobial.
