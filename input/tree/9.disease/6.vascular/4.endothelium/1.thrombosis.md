Pathological arterial or venous thrombi

# .

The endothelium hides subendothelial collagen and tissue factor (preventing primary and secondary hemostatis), produces prostacyclin and nitric oxide (dilating arteries), produces heparin-like molecules (catalyzing antithrombin 3 inactivation of thrombin and coagulation factors), produces tissue plasminogen activator (increasing plasmin blocking platelet connection, destroying coagulation factors, and cleaving cross-linked fibrin and serum fibrinogen.), produces thrombomodulin (redirecting thrombin to activate protein C which inactivates factor 5 and 8.)

Decreased circulation (Virchow triad consists of decreased circualtion, endothelial damage, and hypercoagulability and results in thrombosis.)

Endothelial damage (Virchow triad consists of decreased circualtion, endothelial damage, and hypercoagulability and results in thrombosis.)

Hypercoagulability (Virchow triad consists of decreased circualtion, endothelial damage, and hypercoagulability and results in thrombosis.)

Atherosclerosis

Vasculitis

High urine homocysteine

Ischemia

Thrombocytopenia

Deep vein thrombosis (Most of thrombosis is in the veins below the knees results in deep vein thrombosis.)
