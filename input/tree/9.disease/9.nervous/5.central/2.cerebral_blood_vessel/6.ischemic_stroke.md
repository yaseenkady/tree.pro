Acute local ischemia resulting in focal neurologic deficits lasting more than 24 hours

Stroke

# .

Presentations lasting less than 24 hours are transient ischemic attacks.

# <

Atherosclerosis (Atherosclerosis results in peripheral pale infarcts.)

Thrombosis (Atherosclerotic plaque fragments commonly occlude the middle cerebral arteries and result in thrombotic ischemic stroke.)

Embolism (Atrial fibrillation is the most common cause of embolic stroke. Embolic stroke commonly involves the middle cerebral arteries. Embolic stroke commoly results in peripheral hemorrhagic infacts.)

Lacunar (Hypertension commonly results in hyaline arteriolosclerosis which results in lacunar stroke. Lacunar stroke commonly involves the lenticulostriate vessels and results in small cystic infarcts near the internal capsules and thalamus resulting in pure motor and sensory deficits respectively.)
