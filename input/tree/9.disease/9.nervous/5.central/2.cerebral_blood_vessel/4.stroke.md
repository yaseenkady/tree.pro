Brain hypoperfusion

Cerebrovascular accident

Ischemic brain disease

# .

Neurons are sensitive to decrease in glucose and oxygen and 3-5 minutes of hypoperfusion results in irreversible damage.

The most hypoperfusion vulnerable parts are the following: hippocampus, neocortex, cerebellar Purkinje cells, and watershed areas.

Ischemia and hemorrhage result in 85% and 15% of stroke respectively.

Histological findings are liquefactive necrosis, eosinophilic cytoplasm, pyknotic nuclei, necrosis, neutrophils, microglia, astrocytes, angiogenesis, and gliosis.
