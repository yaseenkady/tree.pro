Acute local ischemia resulting in focal neurologic deficits lasting more than 24 hours

Stroke

# .

# <

Atherosclerosis (Atherosclerosis results in peripheral pale infarcts.)

Thrombotic stroke (Ruptured atherosclerotic plaques result in thrombosis on top of them which occludes the cerebral arteries resulting in ischemic stroke.)

Embolic stroke (Atrial fibrillation is the most common cause of embolic stroke. Carotid artery stenosis, deep vein thrombosis, and infective endocarditis result in embolic stroke. Embolic stroke commonly involves the middle cerebral arteries. Embolic stroke commoly results in peripheral hemorrhagic infacts.)

Lacunar stroke (Hypertension commonly results in hyaline arteriolosclerosis which results in lacunar stroke. Lacunar stroke commonly involves the lenticulostriate vessels and results in small cystic infarcts near the internal capsules and thalamus resulting in pure motor and sensory deficits respectively.)

Hypoxic stroke (Hypoxemia results in ischemic stroke. Hypoxic stroke commonly involves watershed areas.)
