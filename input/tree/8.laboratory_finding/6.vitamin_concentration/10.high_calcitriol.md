85% of vitamin D is from the skin and 15% from the diet.

The liver hydroxylates vitamin D at carbon 25 and then the renal proximal tubule cells hydroxylates it at carbon 1, activating it as calcitriol.

Calcitriol increases renal reabsorption of Ca2+ and PO4-, intestinal absorption of Ca2+ and PO4-, and bone resoption of Ca2+ and PO.
