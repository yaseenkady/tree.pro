Proximal deep veins of lower extremities commonly cause pulmonary embolism

Central pulmonary embolism presents with less pain.

Hypoxemia with normal cardiac and pulmonary exam, plus normal chest x-ray and unilateral leg edema, is indicative.

Fat emboli can be due to long bone fracture and liposuction.

Air emboli can be from N2 or invasive procedures.

Amniotic fluid emboli is rare and can be due to delivery or postpartum or uterine trauma.

Onset is commonly silent because the lungs have 2 blood supplies: pulmonary and bronchial arteries.
