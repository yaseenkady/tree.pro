## Summary

## Name

## PATHOGEN

### Evolve

Beef-oral transmission.

If an egg reaches the cow's intestine, the egg matures into a cyst which disseminates throughout the body.
When a human eats a beef containing a cyst, and if the cyst reaches the small intestine safely, then the cyst matures into a baby worm.
The baby worm sticks to the intestinal wall and matures into an adult worm.
An adult worm is meters long and made of subunits each is as long as a thumb nail and has ovaries and testes, which self fertilize and lay eggs.
The eggs or the subunits exit via feces and are ingested by a cow, repeating the life cycle.

Human is the definitive host.
Cow is the intermediate host.

Can move and get away from feces and be eaten by a cow.
