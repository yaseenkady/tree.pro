Increased plasmin increasing fibrinolysis

Tissue plasminogen activator activates plasminogen into plasmin which does the following:
blocking platelet aggregation and preventing primary hemostasis,
destroying coagulation factors and preventing secondary hemostasis, and
cleaving cross-linked fibrin and serum fibrinogen and preventing thrombosis.

Prostatectomy (Prostatectomy releases urokinase which activate plasmin and results in increased fibrinolysis.)

Cirrhosis (The liver fails to produces a2 antiplasmin which inactivates plasmin and result in increased fibrinolysis.)
