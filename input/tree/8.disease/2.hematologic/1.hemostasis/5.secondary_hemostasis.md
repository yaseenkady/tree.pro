Secondary hemostasis

Coagulation cascade generates thrombin which converts fibrinogen, which connects Gp2b and Gp3a on platelets, into fibrin.

Coagulation cascade requires the following:
liver making coagulation factors and anticoagulation factors,
subendothelial collagen activating intrinsic pathway (factors 12, 11, 9, and 8),
tissues activating extrinsic pathway (factor 7), and
platelet phospholipids and calcium.
