Primary hemostasis

Platelets bind to vascular walls resulting in transient plugs.

Platelet and endothelial cell collaborate and make von Willebrand factor.
A vessel damaged exposes subendothelial collagens.
Von Willebrand factor binds to the exposed collagen.
Platelets' Gp1b receptor binds to the von Willebrand factor.
The platelet secretes ADP and TXA2, which is made using cyclooxygenase.
ADP and TXA2 increase Gp2b or Gp3a receptors on the platelet and the nearby platelets.
Fibrinogen crosslinks Gp2b and Gp3a and connects the platelets.
Coagulation cascade strengthens the connections.
