Thalassemia resulting from loss-of-function variation in a-globin gene on chromosome 16

There are 4 a-globin genes, 2 on each chromosome 16.
Loss-of-function in 2 a-globin genes on the same chromosome is classified as cis a thalassemia and on the different chromosomes is classified as trans a thalassemia.

aa,a- is a thalassemia minima and does not result in anemia.
a-,a- (trans) and aa,-- (cis) is a thalassemia minor and results in mild microcytic, hypochromic anemia.
--,a- is hemoglobin H disease and results in high b4 hemoglobin and severe microcytic, hypochromic an.
--,-- is hemoglobin barts disease and results in high g4 hemoglobin and death before birth.
