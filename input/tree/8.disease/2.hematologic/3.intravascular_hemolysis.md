Hemoglobinuria

Hemosiderinuria (Renal tubular cell takes up hemoglobin and breaks it down into iron which becomes hemosiderin, and their shedding in urine results in hemosiderinuria.)

Low serum haptoglobin (The liver makes haptoglobin which clears serum hemoglobin to avoid hemoglobin's oxidative toxicity.)
