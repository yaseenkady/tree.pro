Autoimmunity

Systemic lupus erythromatous (Systemic lupus erythromatous worsens IgG-mediated extravascular hemolysis, which is warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia.)

B lactam (B lactams triggers IgG-mediated extravascular hemolysis, which is warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia.)

A methyldopa (A methyldopa triggers IgG-mediated extravascular hemolysis, which is warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia.)

Painful blue fingers and toes (IgM- and complement-mediated red blood cell agglutination results in cold autoimmune hemolytic anemia, which is worse at cold, resuliting in painful blue fingers and toes.)

Mycoplasma pneumonias (IgM- and complement-mediated red blood cell agglutination results in cold autoimmune hemolytic anemia.)

Epstein-Bar virus (IgM- and complement-mediated red blood cell agglutination results in cold autoimmune hemolytic anemia.)
