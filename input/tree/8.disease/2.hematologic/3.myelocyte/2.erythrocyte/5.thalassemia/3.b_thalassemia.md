Thalassemia resulting from a loss-of-function variation in b-globin gene on chromosome 11

Low b-globin production is b-thalassemia minor and is commonly asymptomatic and is diagnosed by serum hemoglobin A2 (aadd) higher than 3.5%.

No b-globin production is b-thalassemia major and results in target cell, anisopoikilocytosis, increased marrow resulting in bone deformities, extramedullary hematopoiesis resulting in hepatosplenomegaly, parvovirus-B19 aplastic crisis, and high HbF (aagg) and HbA2 (aadd).

Combination of hemoglobin S and b thalassemia results in moderate sickle cell disease depending on the amount of b-globin production.
