Congenital or acquired protoporphyrin deficiency decreasing heme production in the mitochondria and resulting in microcytic anemia

Erythroid precursor cells convert iron and protoporphyrin into heme in their mitochondria.
Aminolevulinic acid syntherase catalyzes the rate limiting step.
Protoporphyrin deficiency traps iron in the mitochondria resulting in iron-laden mitochondria in the marrow called sideroblasts.

Myelodysplastic syndrome

ALAS (Aminolevulinic acid synterase is the rate-limiting enzyme in protoporphyrin synthesis, so its congenital deficiency results in sideroblastic anemia.)

Alcohol (Alcohol poisons mitochondria and results in sideroblastic anemia.)

Low serum vitamin B6 (Low serum vitamin B6 which is a cofactor for the rate-limiting enzyme in producing protoporphyrin results in sideroblastic anemia.)

Lead (Lead inhibits some non-rate-limiting enzymes for protoporphyrin production and results in sideroblastic anemia.)
