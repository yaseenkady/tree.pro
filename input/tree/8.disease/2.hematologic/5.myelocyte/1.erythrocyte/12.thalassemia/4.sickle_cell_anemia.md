Anemia due to B-globin recessive point mutations

The hemoglobin A (AABB) with the mutant B globin is called hemoglobin S.

Heterozygotes are resistant to Plasmodium falciparum.

African (Sickle cell anemia is the most common autosomal-recessive disease in African descents.)

B globin (A point mutation in b globin gene results in glutamic-acid-to-valine substitution, resulting in hemoglobin S and sickle cell anemia.)

High altitude (Low oxygen environment increases deoxygenated hemoglobin S, which polymerizes and sickles.)

Acidosis (Low oxygen environment increases deoxygenated hemoglobin S, which polymerizes and sickles.)

Newborns initially have high hemoglobin F and less hemoglobin A are asymptomatic.
