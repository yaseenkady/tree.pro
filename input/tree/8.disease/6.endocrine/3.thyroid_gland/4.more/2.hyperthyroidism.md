# .

Increase in binding proteins (thyroid binding globulin, transthyretin, albumin) decreases its thyroid hormone concentration resulting in increased TSH and subsequent production.

1.3% of the US population.

15-20% is due to toxic multinodular goiter.

3-5% is due to toxic adenoma.

50-60% is due to Graves disease.

Accelerates physiology, including bone absorption.

Can be due to high hCG or pituitary adenoma.

Incidence is 5x more in female.

Increases sympathetic stimulation, B adrenergic signaling, and Na-K ATPase expression.

TSH is sensitive to thyroid function.
