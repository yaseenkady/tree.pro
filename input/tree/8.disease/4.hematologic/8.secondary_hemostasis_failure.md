Secondary hemostasis is coagulation cascade generating thrombin which converts fibrinogen, which connects Gp2b and Gp3a on platelets, into fibrin.

Coagulation cascade requires the following:

liver making coagulation factors and anticoagulation factors,

subendothelial collagen activating intrinsic pathway (factors 12, 11, 9, and 8),

tissues activating extrinsic pathway (factor 7), and

platelet phospholipids and calcium.

# <

Liver failure (The liver produces coagulation factors and activate vitamin K so its failure results in secondary hemostasis problem.)

Transfusion (Transfusion dilutes coagulation factors and results in secondary hemostasis problem.)

# >

Bleeding (Secondary hemostasis problem results in re-bleeding after surguries.)
