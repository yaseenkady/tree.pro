Extravascular hemolysis

The splenic, hepatic, and lymphatic macrophage destroying red blood cell.

The macrophage breaks down heme into iron and protoporphyrin, and recycles iron and breaks down protoporph into unconjugated bilirubin.

The unconjugated bilirubin binds to albumin to get to the liver where it is conjugated and excreted as bile.
