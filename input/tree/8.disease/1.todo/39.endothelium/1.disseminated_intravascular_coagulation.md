Disseminated micro thrombosis

Rattlesnake poison (Rattlesnake poison activates coagulation and results in disseminated.)

Sepsis (Sepsis increases IL6 and endotoxins which increase endothelial production of tissue factor which activates factor 7 and results in disseminated intravascular coagulation.)

Trauma

Adenocarcinoma (Adenocarcinoma produces mucin which activates cascade and results in disseminated intravascular coagulation.)

Acute promyelocytic leukemia (Acute promyelocytic leukemia increases myeloblasts which contain primary granules whose contents activate coagulation.)

Child birth (Amniotic fluid contains pro-coagulation factors which cause disseminated intravascular coagulation.)

Acute pancreatitis

Cancer

Nephrotic syndrome (Nephrotic syndrome results in loss of coagulation inhibitors resulting in disseminated intravascular coagulation.)

Transfusion

# >

Purpura fulminans

Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia

Low serum coagulation factor

Thrombocytopenia

Hemostasis problem

Thrombosis

High serum D-dimer (Cross-linked fibrin split and result in D-dimer.)
