Low serum vitamin B12 concentration

Salivary enzymes liberate vitamin B12 from animal proteins.
Salivary R binder carries the liberated vitamin B12 through the stomach.
The gastric parietal cell secrete intrinsic factor.
In the duodenum, pancreatic proteases liberate vitamin B12 from R binder and the free vitamin B12 brinds to intrinsic facotor.
Illeum absorbs vitamin-B12-intrinsic-factor complex.
Vitamin B12 helps DNA synthesis.

Vitamin-B12-deficiency presentations takes years to develop because the liver has high stores.

Vitamin B12 insufficiency accumulates methylmalonic acid and decreases succinyl CoA which is important in fatty acid metabolism and spinal cord myelination.
