B-globin recessive point mutation resulting in red blood cells sickling

The hemoglobin A (AABB) with the mutant B globin is called hemoglobin S.

Heterozygotes are resistant to Plasmodium falciparum.

Sickle cell disease results in greater than 90% hemoglobin S.

Sickling and de-sickling damages the membrane resulting in extravascular and intravascular hemolysis.

African (Sickle cell anemia is the most common autosomal-recessive disease in African descents with 10% of them being carriers.)

B globin (A point mutation in b globin gene results in glutamic-acid-to-valine substitution, resulting in hemoglobin S and sickle cell anemia.)

Hypoxemia (Low oxygen environment increases deoxygenated hemoglobin S, which polymerizes and sickles.)

High altitude (Low oxygen environment increases deoxygenated hemoglobin S, which polymerizes and sickles.)

Dehydration (Dehydration concentrates sickle cells resulting in their polymerization and sickling.)

Acidosis (Low oxygen environment increases deoxygenated hemoglobin S, which polymerizes and sickles.)

Newborns initially have high hemoglobin F and less hemoglobin A are asymptomatic.
