## Name

Syncytio refers to fused infected cells in vitro.

## Feature

Non-segmented genome.
Variable shapes including filamentous.

G protein attachs to the respiratory epithelial cells.
G protein is heavily glycosylated making antibody production difficult.
Secreted G proteins competitively inhibit antibodies.

F protein fuses the viral envelop and an epithelial cell or epithelial cells with each other, enabling transmission.

One serotype.

## Life

Commensal in the nasal cavity.

Infects:

- Bronchus
- Bronchioles
- Dendridic cell
- T cell

Infecting dendritic and T cells interfere with activating adaptive immunity.

Debris clump and slide down the airway, obstructing air flow.

Highly contageous (5-25 people)
Lives 25 min on skin and hours on a surface.
An infected person remains contagious up to 4 weeks.

## Immunity

Antibody against the G and F proteins.
But the immunity is incomplete and shortlived, resulting reinfection.

## Epidemiology

Common cold in adults and more serious disease in infants, yuong adults, elderly, immunocompromised, and ones with ventilation difficulties.

Children get it by 2.

Leading cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in infants and children under 5 world wide.

## Therapy

No vaccine.

Prophylactic with palivizumab, which inhibits the F protein, is for infants and more susceptible popualtion.

Antiviral Ribavirin is approved for children.
