Human specific.

Skin-skin transmision.

Sexually transmitted.

Incubates for 2 weeks to 6 months.

Nucleus looks like 8.

2 membranes.

Half of the genome is for modulating immune response.

Persistent infection with little to no inflammation.

Infects only basal keratinocytes of stratum basale.

Hijacks cytoskeleton.

Rare for DNA viruses, replicates in the cytoplasm.

As the keratinocytes divide and new ones move toward the surface, is transported.

Increases EGFR and secretes EGFR-like molecules to promote proliferation and migration.

By the time an infected keratinocyte reaches stratum corneum, it is packed with viruses.

Blocks NFkB and IL18 pathway to decrease immunity.

Molluscum bodies, also known as Henderson-Paterson bodies, are lipid rich and contains a lot of mature viruses.
