## Summary

## Name

Discovered by bacteriologist Victor Babes.

## PATHOGEN

### Evolve

Babesia has 100s of species, which infect vertebrate erythrocytes worldwide.
Hemolytic diseaes in cattles.
Parasite and the vector identified in 1893.
First human case in 1957.
People with Babesiosis until 1969 had gone splenectomy.

Tick is the vector, like in Lyme disease.

Rodent or deer host.
Tick takes up the gamatocyte, which fertilizes in the tick and becomes sporozoites in the salivary galnd.
Tick is the definitive host.
Tick bites.
Sporozoites enter an animal.
Sporozoites become trophozoite ring, which rapture the red blood cell and fragment into merozoites.
Some merozoites become gametocytes, which are taken by other ticks, repeating the life cycle.

### Enter

Ixodes tick, which bites for 3-4 days
Coinfection with Borrelia burgdorferi.

### Colonize

Red blood cell.

### Persist

Tricks T cells and macrophages to act on RBCs causing hemolysis.

### Replicate

### Exit

## IMMUNITY

### Protect

Splenectomy is a risk factor.

### Detect

### Deploy

### Eliminate

### Remember

## MEDICINE

### Sign and Symptom

Symptoms start 1-8 weeks after the bite.

1-3 weeks incubation.

Flu like symptoms.
Irregular.

Hemolytic anemia in severe cases; splenectomy makes this likely.

Immunocompetent people recover without treatment.

Malaria like with some differences.
Splenomegaly and hepatomegaly are present because of hemolysis.
But renal failure and central nervous system problems are absent because the red blood cells are less sticky than in malaria.

### Diagnosis

Trophozoite stage is diagnosed.

Blood smear; can be mistaken for Malaria.
Malaria has ring inclusion in the red blood cells but babesiosis has cross inclusion.
Antigen and antibody testing.

### Therapy

Clindamycin.

### Prevention

Tick avoidance.

### Epidemiology

New England and Midwest
1000 cases per year
