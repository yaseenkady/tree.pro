Transmission from young reptiles.
In the US, distribution of turtles smaller than 4 inches is banned since 1975; 4 was used because children probably do not want to put any larger ones into their mouth.

Antibiotics use and gastric acid suppression increase the suceptability.
Antibiotics are not usually indicated (results in more reinfection in older children) unless for infants, immunosuppressed, cancer patients, transplant patients, and sickle cell patients to protect systemic spread.
