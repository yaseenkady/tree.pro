+ssRNA virus.

Enveloped.

Arbovirus, which stands for arthropod borne.

Bird reservoir.

Locally infects keratinocytes and then dendritic cells, which transports them to the lymphnodes, where replication occurs.

Proliferates further in the local lymphnode and enters the blood and, if viremia is high, crosses the blood brain barrier.

20% of infection is symptomatic.

1% of infection gets to the central nervous system, 1/2 meningitis and 2/3 encephalitis.

Low level and transient viremia in humans and horses makes them dead end hosts.

First reported in the US in 1999.
