It has co-evolved with human.
Its lineage traces human migrations.
If it had an environmental reservoir, then its lineage should be more independent of human migration.

It transmited oral to oral.
Vomit contains it but poop does not.

It used to be called Campylobacter pylori, because of its similarities to Campylobacter.
It is a Gram- spiral bacillus.
It is an anaerobe, like many other Gram- gastrointestinal bacteria.

It infects only stomach pylorus and lives extracellularly.

Its urease, which is its most abundant protein, converts urea into HCO3- and NH4+ to neutralize H+, to weakly protects itself.

It moves using Flagella.

Flagella are usually immunogenic but its flagella are covered with a membrane that inhibits triggering immunity.

It moves away from acids and aggregate at gastric epithelial junctions, where there is less acid and more mucus cells, whose mucus protects from the H+.

Its adhesins anchor it to the epithelial cell junctions, where it proliferates.

It programs chief cells to supresses HCl secretion and interacts with stem cells deep in the crypt too.

Its CagA gene, found in the pathogenic island, codes for type 4 secretion system, a syringe protein, that inserts into a host cell and stimulates proliferation and downregulates apoptosis, leading to cancer.
CagA stimulates oncogenesis in other cell types too.

Its VacA gene codes for a protein that steals nutrients from a host cell using vacules.

Compared to other Gram- gastrointestinal bacteria, it replicates slower.

Like other Gram- bacteria, it has lipopolysacharide, which usually is immunogenic but not in the its case.
It mutated the gene for the Lipid A and added blood group antigen like molecules to the O antigen to make the lipopolysacharide less immunogenic.

It also programs T regulatory cells to promote its tolerance.

## Epidemiology

Discovered in 1984.
The most common infection in human; 50% of people are infected.

Almost all childhood are infected by 10.
The infecting strain usually persists lifetime.

50% of the infected people develop symptoms.

Its infective ulcer anti-correlates with gastric cancer, esophageal cancer, childhood asthma, and Mycobacteria tuberculosis.

## Medicine

Urease breath test: drink carbon labeled labeled urea and measure exhaled CO2.
Check for anemia because of ulcer.
Antibody in blood.
Antigen in stool.
Endoscopy and biopsy.

People who should be treated:

- Anemia
- Ulcer
- Stroke
- Cancer

Japan is treatng its whole population in hopes to reduce gastric cancer.

Triple therapy for 4 weeks: omeprazome, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin.

Gastritis
(100% of symptomic patients; Histological)

(15% of symptomic patients; Strongest risk fasctor for; Ulcer of antrum and pylorus)

Duodenal Ulcer
(15% of symptomic patients; Strongest risk fasctor for)

Vomit

Anorexia

Gastric Cancer
(Strongest risk fasctor for; 1% of infected people; The risk of can be as high as getting lung cancer from smoking; Associated with corpus-predominant gastritis and multi-focal atrophic gastritis)
