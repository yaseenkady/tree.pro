## Summary

Staphylococcus aureus (Sus) is a bacteria that lives on skin and, deploying various toxins, can cause food poisoning, damage local tissues, and persistently infect various tissues.

## Name

Staphylococcus means grapes-like, describing how they look under a microscope.
Aureus means golden, the color of their colony.

## Habitat

Sus lives on moist keratinized epithelium, like skin, upper respiratory tract, and lower reproductive tract.
It can be found in 30% of people.

Sus is a Gram+ bacteria.
20% of its genome is dynamic and is exchanged among the members, making a population of Sus diverse.
Sus makes energy by oxidation and fermentation.
Sus can not move, but has various adhesion proteins that can stick to peptidoglycan, an abundant protein found in various tissues.

On the epithelium, Sus secretes enterotoxin, swallowing which causes food poisoning.

If Sus crosses the epithelium, it anchors to and infects the local tissue.
Usually, a team of heterogeneous Sus simultaneously invade.
The Sus proliferate and forms a colony.
Local immune cells detect the invasion and try to destroy the colony.

But Sus is good at protecting itself from the immune system.
First, Sus forms biofilm to shield itself.
Sus can even team with fungus Candida albicans to reinforce the biofilm.
Sus also activates the host's fibrin to form thrombotic wall to block itself from its surrounding.
Because Sus can make energy by fermentation, it can survivie within the O2 poor walled environment.

Neutrophils gather trying to destroy Sus.
Instead of directly fighting back against the neutrophils, Sus forms abscesses with neutrophils.
Neutrophils secrete H2O2, which oxidizes various microbes.
But Sus's golden carotenoid pigment Staphyloxanthin neutralizes H2O2 into H2O and O2, not only disabling the attack but also generating O2, a potential energy source.
Neutrophils also secrete DNA traps to cover Sus.
But Sus secretes DNAse which breaks down the traps.

Because Sus are commensal, people have antibodies against Sus.
The antibogy's antigen end binds to Sus and the FC end binds to macrophage, signaling the macrophage to eat the Sus.
But Sus secretes protein A, which covers the FC region to prevent macrophage activation.

The local battle between Sus and the immune system escalates.
More immune cells and weapons start to arrive.
The immune system is persistent and usually gets rid of the Sus colony eventually.
But Sus fights back by secreting various toxins.
Leukocidin punctures immune cells.
Hemolysins lyses red blood cells so that Sus can steal Fe, an rare element that pathogens like to eat.
Exofoliative toxin breaks down epidermis and hyaluronidase breaks down hyaluronic acid in connective tissues, so that Sus can invade deeper.
Lipases, phospholipases, and proteases also break down whatever is in the way so that Sus can spread.

Its signature toxin is toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 (TSST1), which havocs the entire immune system.
TSST1 spreads by circulates and links T cell receptors and non-specific MHC2s, wrongly activating T cells.
Activated T cells orchestrate more immune activations and throught the body unnecessary immune reactions become decoy so that the immune system can not focus on the growing Sus colony.

If the immune system fails to contian the local Sus infection, Sus spreads via circualtion and seeds to places with peptidoglycans, like joints and heart valves, surfaces with microscopic damages, and surfaces of implants.
At new sites, Sus build wall, form abscess, secrete toxins, and invade deeper, repeating the cycle.

Its diagnoses by culturing blood or stool.
The culture grows bacteria that are grape-like, Gram+-, coagulase+, catalase+, and DNAse+.

Like many other Gram+ bacteria with thick cell wall, Sus used to be treated with simple cell wall inhibitors (beta lactams) (penicillin).
Cell wall inhibitors bind to and disables PBP, enzyme that builds the bacterial cell wall.

But some Sus acquired the gene that codes for beta lactamase, enzyme that breaks down beta lactams.
Then, new cell wall inhibitors that are resistant to beta lactamase (nafcillin) was developed and became the specific antibiotic against Sus.

However, some Sus then acquired the macA gene, which codes for PBP2a, mutated PBP enzyme that does not bind to beta lactams.
mecA gene is part of the dynamic genome, so more Sus is gaining the ability to make PBP2a.
These Sus are called the methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).
(Methicillin is an older beta lactam that is not used for treatment anymore but is used to test for resistance agaisnt beta lactam.)
Beta lactams are not effective against MRSA.

To kill MRSA, vancomycin, antibiotic that disrupts cell wall D-Alanine-D-Alanine crosslinking, is developed.
So if a person has Sus infection and if Sus is MRSA, then vancomycin is used.

However, recently, some Sus acquired the ability to crosslink the cell wall with D-Alanine-D-LACTATE, which escapes binding to vancomycin.
These are vancomycin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (VRSA).

Developing new antibiotics against VRSA has become urgent.
Some people are engineering bacteriophages that can kill VRSA.

There is no vaccine against Sus.
