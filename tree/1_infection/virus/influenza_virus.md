## Summary

RNA virus that causes the common cold.

## Name

Flu was believe to be caused by the influence of the starts.

## PATHOGEN

### Evolve

Reservior is aquatic birds.

Orthomyxo family: segmented -ssRNA genome, helical capsid, and envelop; spherical; RNA polymerase.
Unline other RNA viruses, RNA replication takes place in the nucleus; other such outlier RNA viruses include the retroviruses and the hepatitis D virus.

Influenza A infects water birds, swine, and human.
Influenza B and C infect human.
Influenza B is milder.
Influenza C is mildest.
Influenza A has 16 subtypes, named by the combination of hemaglutinin and neuramidase; H1N1 is one of them.
Because influenza A infects human and animals, antigenic shift through an animal can happen.

Shuffling of RNA segments of multiple viruses infecting the same cell results in a new strain.

H1N1 caused the Spanish flu pandemic in 1918-19 (target young people).
H2N2 caused the Asian flu pandemic in 1957-58.
H3N2 caused the Hong Kong pandemic flu in 1968-69.
H5N1 caused avian flu epidemic in poultry in Hong Kong with 60% mortality in 2003-4.
Swine H1N1 caused the Swine flu pandemic in 2009 April - 2010 April (target young people).
H7N9 caused avian flu epidemic in poultry in China with in 2013.

-ssRNA.
RNA polymerase.
Spherical capsid.
Membrane.
Hemaglutinin.
Neuramidase digests mucus and cuts sialic acid to release viruses from a cell.

### Enter

Transmit via respiratory droplets.

Infects cells of the respiratory tract.
Neuramidase digests mucus.
Hemaglutinin binds to sialic acid (found on respiratory epithelial cells [more in the upper respiratory tract] and red blood cells), epithelial cell membrane protein, and the virus enters.
Hemaglutinins bind to the red blood cells and clump or agglutinate them.

### Colonize

Bronchus.
Bronchiole.
All respiratory tract.
Incubates for 3 days.

### Persist

Hemaglutinin inhibits antibodies.

### Replicate

Replicates in the epithelial cell.
When exiting the cell, new virus cut sialic acid with neuramidas to burst out of the cell.

### Exit

Sheds more virus in the beginning.
Infects nearby epithelial cells or exit the person via cough or fluid.

## IMMUNITY

### Protect

Respiratory epithelial cells brush them out of the airway.
Goblet cells secrete mucus to keep them away.

Antibodies against hemaglutinin reduces infectivity.
Antibodies against neuramidase reduces disease burden.

### Detect

Hemaglutinin and neuramidase.

### Deploy

### Eliminate

### Remember

Genes coding for hemaglutinin and neuramidase mutate, and, when 2 strains infect the same cell, recombine.

## MEDICINE

### Sign and Symptom

Bronchitis.

Bronchiolitis.

Pneumonia.

Damaged respiratory epithelium is more suspectable to bacterial infection.
Cytokin storm aches the entire body.
Rhinorrhea, congestion, dry cough, myalgia, pharyngitis, headache.
Lower respiratory tract infection: shortness of breath.

### Diagnosis

Multiple serotypes.

Clinical diagnosis.

### Therapy

Oseitamivir inhibits neuramidase.
For people younger than 18, avoid aspirin to avoid Reye syndrome.

### Prevention

Humidify air.
Mask.
Passive immunity across placenta.

### Epidemiology

30% (2nd most common, after rhinovirus) of upper respiratory infection.
Secondary bacterial infection has 5-10% fatality.
Infects up to 1/5 population per year, targetting the young, the old, and the weak.
Up to 0.5 million death per year.

Second most common cause of the community acquired pneumonia.
