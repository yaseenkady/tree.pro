## Summary

## Name

## PATHOGEN

### Evolve

Cat = felines.
Reside in gastrointestinal epithelial cell.
Many eggs in cat feces.
Many animals can eat the eggs and eggs become tachyzoite to invade tissus, and eventually become dormant bradyzoites.
Bradyzoite become tachyzoite when the immunocompromised or being ingested by other animals.
Being ingested by cat results in bradyzoite getting into the gastrointestinal epithelial cells and reproduce, repeating the cycle.

Cat is the definite host, so it reproduces in a cat.
Cat poop and uncooked food carry the oocyte, which can get to water and soil.
Many intermediate hosts including human.

Ingesting cysts can infect too.

### Enter

Oral transmission from:

- Water containing cat feces containing oocysts.
- Soil or undercooked meat.

### Colonize

Exclusively intracellular.
Apical complex is an organel that penetrates a host cell.
Invades almost all nucleated cells.
Dissemiates via blood or lymph.
Monocytes transport them.

Oocyte becomes tachyzoite, which travels to the central nervous system and becomes bradyzoite.

### Persist

Oocytes are resistant, viable in soil up to 18 months.
High temperature kills oocytes.

### Replicate

Bradyzoites remain dormant.
Tachyzoites replicate every 6-8 hours.

### Exit

Any mammal (including marine ones) or bird can be an intermediate host.
Cat eats an intermediate host and takes it up, repeating the cycle.

## IMMUNITY

### Protect

### Detect

### Deploy

### Eliminate

### Remember

Antibody against tachyzoite.

## MEDICINE

### Sign and Symptom

Bradyzoite form is in the cyst.
The immune system keeps them in check.
When immunocompromised, then the bradyzoite becomes tachyzoite and becomes symptomatic.

Infect AIDS patients, neonates, and normal hosts.

Dormant for life.

Asymptomatic in immunocompetent people.
Constitutional symptoms.
Lymphadenopathy.
Increase risk tolerance.

Congenital toxoplasmosis leads to hydrocephalus.

In immunocompromised patients, central nervous system infection is the most common.

Reactivates in immune compromised hosts, and causes diseases in the lungs, eyes (chorioretinitis), and other organs.

### Diagnosis

MRI.
Biopsy shows cyst.
Serology of IgM (positive in acute setting) and IgG.

### Therapy

Pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine, a combination that inhibits thymidine synthesis.
Trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole inhibit the same enzymes.

### Prevention

Avoid cats and raw meat.

### Epidemiology

World wide.
The most virulent forms are in South America.
