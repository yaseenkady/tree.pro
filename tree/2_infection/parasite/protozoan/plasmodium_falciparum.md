Fever every 3 days.

Plasmodium malaria causes fever every 4 days.

## Summary

## Name

Stagnant water made air bad or mal air.
And people from these places got the disease.

## PATHOGEN

### Evolve

Lives on stagnant water.

Extraerythrocytic and erythrocytic phases.

### Enter

Anopheles mosquito bite transmits sporozoite.

### Colonize

Move with cilia to reach blood or lymph.

Sporozoite infects hepatocyte and becomes schizont, which matures and fragments into merozoite over 2 weeks.
Plasmodium ovale and Plasmodium vivar incubate for longer time as hypnozoite and have a latent phase so treating the blood phase is not enough because the latent liver forms can activate later.

Hypnozoite can be dormant for years.

Merozoites exit being wrapped by the host cell membranes and are undected by the immune system, spill into the blood stream and infect the red blood cells, becoming trophozoite.

Trophozoite lyse its red blood cell to exit and infect other red blood cell.

Some merozoites become gametocytes, which do not lyse their red blood cells, instead are taken up by other mosquitos.

Liver phase: sporozoite, schizont, merozoite
Blood phase: trophozoite, schizont, gametocytes

### Persist

Eat hemoglobin.
Pack waste.

Express adhesins in the infected red blood cells to make them sticky to peripheral endothelium and avoid reaching the spleen, which breaks them down.
Sticky red blood cells causes ischemia and infarction.
Lactic acidosis.

### Replicate

Schzonts spill out to the circulation as merozoites.
Merozoites infect lung capillary red blood cells, which move slowly.
The infected red blood cells stick to organs including spleen and brain and rapture.
Inside the red blood cells, merozoites become trophozoites (ring like) and in some red blood cells gametocytes (banana like).
Mosquitoes take up the red blood cells containing the gametocytes.

### Exit

Gametocytes exit via another merozoite bite.

## IMMUNITY

### Protect

Sickle cell red blood cells resist infection.

### Detect

### Deploy

### Eliminate

### Remember

## MEDICINE

### Sign and Symptom

Malaria.
Hemolytic anemia.
Constitutional symptoms.
Headache.
No abdominal pain or rash.
Fever cycle of 24 to 48 hours.
Hepatomegaly.
Juandice.
Splenomegaly.
Renal failure.
Cerebral malaria: seizure and altered mental status.
Placental malaria.

Low platelet.
High bilirubin.
Normal white blood cell.

Can be asymptomatic in adults in endemic populations because they develop partial immunity.

### Diagnosis

Thick (identify organism in the red blood cell) and thin (identify species) smears.
If smear is not available, antigen testing.

### Therapy

Act at blood phase.

Chroloquine (inhibits crystalizing heme, which is toxic to Plasmodium).
Artemisinin.

### Prevention

Kill mosquitos.
Repel mosquitos.

Chemical prophylaxis; because Plasmodium species can stay latent in the liver for weeks, the prophylaxis is given for 4 weeks after leaving the endemic area.

### Epidemiology

Equator countries.
Tropical and subtropical climate, found in central Africa and amazon forrests.

Falciparum is the most common and deadliest because it infects more red blood cells.

200 million cases and 600,000 deaths (mostly African children) per year.
