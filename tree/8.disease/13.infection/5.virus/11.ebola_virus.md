Bat reservoirs and infects primates.

-ssRNA genome, non-segmented.

Enveloped and filamentous.

Infects bats and primates.

5 species.

Mucusal transmission.

Initially, infects and replicates within monocytes and spreads to endothelial cells and then other cell types, except lymphocytes and neurons.

Infected monocytes become worse at mediating immune processes and activates coagulation.

Sheds decoy proteins to absorb antibodies.

Cytokines induce lymphocyte apoptosis.

Systemic immune reaction.

Exits by blood, feces, vomitus, milk, and various bodily excretions.

40% mortality.
