## Name

The official name is Human parainfluenza virus.

## Feature

4 major serotypes, each considered as separate viruses with numbered suffix.
Human parainfluenza virus 1 typically causes croup.

Not related to influenza virus but has hemagglutinin and neuraminidase.

Serotypes with the most efficient replication and transcription have genome length divisible by 6, a mystery.

## Life

Can stay for hours in the environment.

Human specific.
Infects:

- Trachea
- Bronchus
- Alveolus (common)

Infected cell has larger cytoplasm.

Buds out from the apical surface, without killing the cell.
Less viremia.

Increases host cell replication, increating mucus cells, debris, and swelling, which descends to trachea.

Reinfection is common because it buds from the apical surface, without being seen by the immune cells and not triggering complete immunity.

## Epidemiology

Respiratory syncytial virus and parainfluenza virus are top 2 causes of respiratory hospitalization in children under 5 years old.

## Therapy

No vaccine.

Diagnose with culture, antigen, nucleic acid, or IgG

Corticosteroid and nebulizer for croup.
