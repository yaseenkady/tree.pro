Microfilaria is a microscopic worm, less than 1mm, and lives in mosquito.

Microfilaria eats bacteria in mosquitos, which are called wolbachia bacteria.

Mosquito bite releases microfilaria into a human.

Microfilaria gets to the lymphatic system and grows there to few cms and reproduce more microfilaria.

Microfilaria ventures into the blood stream at night and when new mosquito bites this person, then microfilaria exits.

Adult worms obstruct the lymphatics.

Nocturnal blood films.

IgG4 is specific.

Treat with doxycycline to kill the wolbachia and albendazole.

DEC kills microfilaria but spares the adult worms.
