## Name

Named after the 1976 mysterious deadly pneumonia outbreak at the American Legion convention, PA.

## Feature

Most common and the only disease causing species in the Lerionella family, which consists of 42 species.

Small.
Gram-.
Thin bacillus (rod) that can change shape.
Facultative intracellular parasite of amoeba.

Aerobic.
b lactamase.
Catalase positive.
Oxidase positive.

## Life

Waterborne.

Survives 2min in 60C water.
Detectable in 55C water.

From habitat water, aerosol transmission to alveoli.

Infects macrophage as if it was an amoeba.
Coiling phagocytosis (rare) by alveolar macrophage.

Dot/Icm type IV secretion/translocation system, which uses 27 proteins.
Goes to mitochondria and steals their vesicles being shipped to the rough endoplasmic reticulum.
Also steals vesicles derived from the Golgi apparatus.
Replicates within this vesicle, which resembles the rough endoplasmic reticulum.

Lyse the cell and exit.

Incubates for 2-10 days, with median 7 and max 19.

No person-person transmission.

## Epidemiology

Prevent infection with:

- Water disinfection
- Water softer
- Modern plumbing designs (more flexible plumbing materials such as latex or cPVC contain much more than copper or glass ones)
- Avoiding public water supplies (where there is more carbon and less maintenance)

## Medicine

Grow on charcoal yeast extract agar containing iron and cysteine.
Stain with silver.

Legionella pneumophila is often found unilaterally in a lower lobe without a typical radiograph pattern.
Saliva or urinary antigen test.

Erythromycin, doxycycline, azithromycin, and fluoroquinolone in severe cases.
