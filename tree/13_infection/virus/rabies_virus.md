-ssRNA genome encodes 5 genes.

Bullet shaped.

Cains and bats are the reservoirs.

Infects mammals.

Raccoons, skunks, bats, and foxes in the US and dogs worldwide accounting for over 90% of cases.

Transmission from aminal bodily fluids.

Incubates for 1-3 months.

Neurotropic.

Binds to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and infects muscle cells initially and then motor neurons and, in 3-12 weeks, the brain.

Replicates in the muscle cell before going to neurons, and this may be why the incubation time is 1-3 months.

Travels on microtubules and does not kill infected neurons, 5-10cm per day.

After reaching the brain, the virus spreads via somatic and autonomic nerves to reach many tissues including salivary glands, where it buds out and mix with saliva.

Infects salivary grands.

Fatal.

Post exposure prophylaxis with immunoglobulin within 72 hours.

Antibody response occurs too late.

Ascending flaccid paralysis.

Dogs account for 90% of cases in the world.

Bats, skunks, racoons, and foxes are most likely source in the US.
