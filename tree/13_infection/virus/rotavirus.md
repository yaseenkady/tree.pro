Rota refers to wheel.
Encapsulated with 3 layers.
Non-enveloped; so resistant in the environment.

dsRNA genome in 11 segments, each coding for a protein.

Moternal antibodies wane by 6 months.

Fecal-oral transmission.
Resists acid, digestive enzymes, and bile salts.
Activates and infects mature enterocytes found at the tips of small intestine villi.
Spreads systemically to neighboring enterocytes.
Proliferation and lysis blunts the villi.
Villi recover after an infection.

Diarrhea is from:

- Blunted villi have less surface area for absorption and brush border enzymes
- Non-structural protein 4 leaks Cl-
- Another protein activates the enteric nervous system promoting fluid secretion

IgA and immune memory make reinfection milder.

## Medicine

Vaccines are indicated for children.
