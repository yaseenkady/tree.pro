Oocysts persist in stool for months and develop sporozoites.

Oocysts transmit fecal-orally and release sporozoites in small intestine.

Sporozoites invades intestinal epithelial cells, divide into merozoites, and repeat the proliferation cycle.

Merozoites develop male and female, which fertilize and release oocysts in the stool.
