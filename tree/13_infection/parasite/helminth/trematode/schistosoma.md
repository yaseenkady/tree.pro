Male is flat and curls (fluke shaped) to make a groove to hold onto a female, continuously reproducing for life.

Human is the definitive host.

Infeced human's urine or feces contain the eggs.

Eggs get into shelled animals and hatch.

Hatched babies exit into water.

The babies mature in the liver and lay eggs.

The eggs penetrate to intestinal tract or urinary tract lumen.

Eosinophilic reaction causes diseses.
