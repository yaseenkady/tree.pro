Antibiotics associated toxin-secreting bacteria that inflames the colon.

Non-toxic strains are part of the microbiome but toxin-secreting ones are pathogenic.

Gram+ rod.
Anaerobe (common to use spores).

Spores are in feces and in the environment.
In healthcare settings, spores commonly transmit via any medical items; wash hands.
Spores show up less stained in a Gram staining.
Alcohol is not effective at breaking the spores but bleach is.

Small number of asymptomatic carriers are reserviors.

Gastric acid kills them.
People on antibiotics or gastric acid suppression are suceptible to infection.
Once having reached the small intestine, bile activates the spores.
Active forms colonizes gastrointestinal tract if the commensal microbes are weak.

Uses 2 toxins: toxin A and toxin B.
B is more potent than A.
Toxins activate neutrophils, inflames the local tissue, disrupts the tight junctions, and degrades epithelial cells and immune cells.
The debris form plaque.

Risk factors:

- Antibiotics
- Hospitalization
- Elderly
- Severe illness
- Gastric acid suppression
- Chemotherapy

Asymptomatic patients do not need treatment.

Diagnose with fecal toxin antigen test.

Treat younger patient with oral metronidazole and older patient with oral vancomycin.
Fecal transplant high cure rate in refractory cases.
