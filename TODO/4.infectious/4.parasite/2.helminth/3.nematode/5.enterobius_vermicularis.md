Pinworm or threadworm.

Simplest gastrointestinal nematodes whose lifecycle takes place entirely in the humans.

Fecal-oral transmission of eggs, which look like domes.

Eggs hatch in the stomach and the babies mature as they get to the cecum, where they mate.

Pregnant females travel to the anus and lay eggs, which is gue-like and cause itch.

Humans are the definitive hosts.

Most infections are asymptomatic.

There is no immune response because the worms stay in the lumen entirely.

Diagnose by identifying eggs in the stool.

Repeat stool culture up to 6 times.

Treat with albendazole or pyrantel.
