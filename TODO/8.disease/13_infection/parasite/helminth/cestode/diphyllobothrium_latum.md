Fish tapeworm.

Freshwater fish are the intermediate hosts, containing cysts.

When humans, the definitive hosts, eat uncooked fish containing the cysts, the cysts release worm heads in human stomach and the heads grow in the intestine, maturing and laying eggs.

Fish-oral transmission.

The eggs exit in the stool and, if they get to fresh water, hatch into cyclops, which are eaten by fish.

Most infections are asymptomatic.

Diagnose by identifying the eggs, which have hats, in the stool.

Worms stay in the lumen, so there is no eosinophilic reaction.

Treat with praziquantel.

Freeze the fish for 2 days before cooking to damage the cysts.
