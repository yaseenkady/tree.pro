# Comment

3 stages: 1) early localized, 2) early disseminated, and 3) late disseminated.

Treatment-persistent infection is rare, but the symptoms can persist.

# Epidemiology

Exposure to tick
(The most common tick-borne disease in the US. Over 30000 cases per year.)

Endemic in the Eastern US

# Symptom

Flu-like

# Sign

Erythema migrans

Joint effusion

# Diagnostic

Arthritis

Meningitis

Neuropathy in cranial nerve 7

Myopathy

Borrelia burgdorferi
(Test people with both symptom and objective finding. 2 stage testing: 1) ELISA of antibody against the whole Borrelia burgdorferi lysate and, if positive, 2) western blot of IgM (if symptomatic within 30 days) and IgG against specific antigens. Antibody tests are sensitive 30 days after the exposure, and have high cross reactivity against other microbes. PCR testing of synovial fluids and CFS is available, but it also has low sensitivity and high cross reactivity.)

Babesia
(Coinfection.)
