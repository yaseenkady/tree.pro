# tree.pro

The tree of clinically-relevant medical knowledge :hospital:

## Principle

Avoid abbreviations.

Write causally and logically.

## Ordering

Broad-to-narrow

Superficial-to-deep

Top-to-bottom

Decreasing accessibility

Increasing

## Wording

Use `[0-9]`s.

`decreased` and `increased`: :arrow_down: and :arrow_up: in :bust_in_silhouette:

`low` and `high`: :arrow_down: and :arrow_up: in :busts_in_silhouette:

`defect`: congenital :warning:

`diminished`: :arrow_down: amplitude in :busts_in_silhouette:

`prolonged`: :arrow_up: time in :busts_in_silhouette:

`poor`: :arrow_down: abstraction that does not have the corresponding :arrow_up:

`deficiency`: :arrow_down: thing that does not have the corresponding :arrow_up:

Use the most medical terms.

## Branch

`Demography` / `Feature` / `.md`

`Medical History` / `Event` / `.md`

`Medication` / `Class` / `Medication` `.md`

`Family Medical History` / `Family Event` / `.md`

`Genome` / `Chromosome` / `Gene` `.md`

`Social History` / `Environmental Factor` / `.md`

`Presentation` / `Body` / `Symptom and Sign` `.md`

`Laboratory Finding` / `Measurable` / `Finding` `.md`

`Disease` / `System` / `Body` / `State` `.md`

## `.md`

A `.md` name is the file's variable name, which, instead of being medically sound, should follow the [wording principles](#wording).

`.md`s are `node`s.
