# tree.pro

The tree of clinically-relevant medical knowledge :stethoscope:

## Principle

Avoid abbreviations.

Use medical terms.

Write causally and logically.

### Wording

Use `[0-9]`s.

`decreased` and `increased`: :arrow_down: and :arrow_up: in :bust_in_silhouette:

`defect`: congenital :warning:

`diminished`: :arrow_down: amplitude in :busts_in_silhouette:

`prolonged`: :arrow_up: time in :busts_in_silhouette:

`poor`: :arrow_down: that does not have the corresponding :arrow_up:

`low` and `high`: :arrow_down: and :arrow_up: in :busts_in_silhouette:

### Ordering

General-to-specific

Superficial-to-deep

Top-to-bottom

Decreasing accessibility

Increasing

## `Branch`

### `Presentation`

Body / Finding `node` / ...

### `Disease`

System / Body / Disease `node` / ...

## `.md`

`.md`s are `node`s. 

A `.md` name is the file's variable name, which, instead of being medically sound, should follow the [wording principles](#wording).

### `# .`

The first line of `# .` is the variable name description, and should not end with a period, but can have `|` separating synonyms.

The descriptions should imply a patient.

### `# <`

### `# >`
