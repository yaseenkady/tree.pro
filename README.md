# tree.pro

The tree of clinically-relevant medical knowledge :hospital:

## Principle

Avoid abbreviations.

Write causally and logically.

## Ordering

Broad-to-narrow

Superficial-to-deep

Top-to-bottom

Increasing magnitude

## Wording

Use `[0-9]`s.

`decreased` and `increased` carry a personal context

`low` and `high` carry a population context

`diminished` refers to `decreased` amplitude

`prolonged` refers to `increased` time

`defect` refers to a congenital problem

`deficit` refers to a nervous problem

Use the most medical terms.

## Branch

`Demography` / `Demographic Feature` / `.md`

`Medical History` / `Medical Event` / `.md`

`Medication` / `Medication Class` / `.md`

`Family Medical History` / `Family Event` / `.md`

`Genome` / `Chromosome` / `.md`

`Social History` / `Environmental Feature` / `.md`

`Presentation` / `Body Part` / `.md`

`Laboratory Finding` / `Measurable` / `.md`

`Disease` / `System` / `Body Part` / `.md`

## `.md`

`.md`s are `node`s.

A `.md` name is the file's variable name, which, instead of being medically sound, should follow the [wording principles](#wording).

## Block

### `# =`

Description and synonyms

### `# .`

Describe this state.

Include only descriptions that help practicing medicine.

### `# <`

Previous state
