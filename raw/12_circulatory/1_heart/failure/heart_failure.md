Clinical diagnosis.

Cold means low cardiac output, associated with: fatigue, anorexia, tachycardia, low pulse pressure, cold extremities, and elevated lactate.

Cor pulmonale is isolated right heart failure due to pulmonary cause.

Dry and cold heart failure is the worst because there is not much to diuresis.

Left heart failure often causes right one.

Left ventricular heart failure causes secondary hyperaldosteronism.

There are 2 functional types: heart failure with 1) reduced or 2) preserved ejection fraction.

Wet means volume overload, associated with: dyspnea, orthopnea, pitting edema, hypoxemia, crackles, high jagular venous distention, dilated inferior vena cava, and high blood brain natridiuretic peptide.
