Clinical diagnosis.

Left ventricular heart failure causes secondary hyperaldosteronism.

Left heart failure often causes right one.

Cor pulmonale is isolated right heart failure due to pulmonary cause.

There are 2 functional types: heart failure with 1) reduced or 2) preserved ejection fraction.

Cold means low cardiac output, associated with: fatigue, anorexia, tachycardia, low pulse pressure, cold extremities, and elevated lactate.

Wet means volume overload, associated with: dyspnea, orthopnea, pitting edema, hypoxemia, crackles, high jagular venous distention, dilated inferior vena cava, and high blood brain natridiuretic peptide.

Dry and cold heart failure is the worst because there is not much to diuresis.
