Transmitted by blood.
Binds to lipoproteins and gets to hepatocytes.
Unlike hepatitis B virus, does not enter the nucleus but can persist in the endoplasmic reticulum system, hiding using lipoproteins and existing as lipoviral particles.
Copies RNA with its RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which is error prone, and makes proteins to assemble new viruses, which exit without killing the host cell.

Less likely to be cleared than hepatitis B virus.
15% resolution and 85% asymptomatic chronic hepatitis.
20% progresses to cirrhosis in 20 years.
The chance of hepatocellualr carcinoma increases 4% per year.

Detection is not difficult but 75% of infected people are undiagnosed because of lack of symptoms.

Therapies targetting the viral RNA-dependen RNA polymerase and protease are effective and achieve cure.

Prevelant in North Africa, Middle East, and Asia.
In the US, it causes hepatocellular carcinoma more than hepatitis B virus.
Most common blood bourne chronic infection in the US.

Treatment and response differs by serotype.
Most common cause of liver transplant.

Sexually transmitted.
