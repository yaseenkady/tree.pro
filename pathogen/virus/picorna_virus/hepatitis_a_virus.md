## Summary

Virus that causes a self-limited liver infection.

## Feature

PicoRNA virus.
+ssRNA genome.
Human specific.
Naked capsid is resistant and is infectious up to a year in fresh or sea water and for days on environmental surfaces and hands.
Shellfish concentrates viruses.
Realted to rhinovirus, poliovirus, and the enteroviruses.
Infects only humans and primates.
Environment is the reservoir.

## Life Cycle

Is fecal-oral transmitted, crosses the intestinal epithelium, gets to the liver, and is endocytosed into hepatocytes.
Makes a hole in the endosome and releases +ssRNA, which is ready to be translated.
Genomic replication takes places by first making dsRNA and then cleaving it into +ssRNA pieces.
Translation and replication is slower than those of enteroviruses, and thus incubates longer up to 50 days with mean of 30 days.

Buds out to the apical side, bile canaliculi.
Exists with bile.
Envelop is stripped by bile.

Infectivity peaks 1-2 weeks before the symptoms.

CD8 T cells, NK cells, and antibodies get rid of the virus.

There is no recurrent infection, unless there is other conditions.

## Diagnosis

Severity of symptoms correlates with age, like in SARS-COVID2 infection.

## Treatment

And the vaccine, which is made of formalin-fixed whole virus, confers life-time protection.
The vaccine is recommended for all children at age 1 in the US.

The vaccine can be used as post-expopsure porphylaxis within 2 weeks.
Treating people younger than 1 and elderly with immunoglobulin.

Fecal so sanitize.

Poor Hygiene

IV Drug Use

Homelessness

Man who Have Sex with Men
