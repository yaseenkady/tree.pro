## Summary

Virus that causes self-limited acute hepatitis, especially during pregnancy.

## Feature

Belongs to hepeviridae family, which is simialr to picornaviridae.
Naked capsid that is tough.
+ssRNA genome.
Animals are the reservior and is zoonotic.

## Life

Fecal-oral transmitted from water in the developing countries and animal in developed countries.
Some strains are endemic.
Crosses the intestinal epithelium, gets to the liver, and is endocytosed by hepatocytes.
From the endocome, releases +ssRNA genome into the cytosol.
+ssRNA is ready for translation and also for making dsRNA, which is then fragmented into +ssRNA.
Translates slowly and incubates longer (longer than hepatitis A virus).
Exits with bile.
Sheds more before symptoms.
Fails kidneys and brain too.

Buds out to the apical side, bile canaliculi.
Envelop is stripped by bile.

Can become chronic in immunocompromised people.
Reinfection is more likely than hepatitis A virus.

Fecal so sanitize.

## Risk Factor

Pregnancy

## Diagnosis

IgM is a sign of acute infection.
PCR confirms infection.
