Genome can be double stranded DNA, negative single stranded RNA, or positive single RNA (which is like mRNA).
Lacks ribosome, so the translation relies on the machinaries of the infected cell.

Move by diffusion.

Enters a cell by attaching to the cell and endocytosis.
Escapes endosome.
DNA genome goes to the nucleus, sometimes integrating, and code for new viral particles.
RNA genome replicates in the cytosol.
The particles assemble into viruses in the endoplasmic reticulum or the cytosol.
The viruses exit, being wrapped by the cell membrane, and infect other cells.

Suppresses hematopoiesis more in children.

Nucleic acid:
Capsid: resistant to detergent but susceptible to acid.
Envelop: susceptible to detergent.

RNA viruses use their own polymerases and mutate more because the replication is error prone.

Decrease immune response.
Inhibits apoptosis.

Viral respiratory tract infection:

- Most common illness in the US

Identifying respiratory infection virus is important because we can treat influenza virus, severe infections, use experimental antiviral therapies, and cohort the patients so others to avoid infecting others in a hospital.

Testing:
Nasopharyngeal swab.
Antibody (fast but nto sensitive).
PCR (preferred but expensive).
Serology (tests history, antibodies take time to develop).
