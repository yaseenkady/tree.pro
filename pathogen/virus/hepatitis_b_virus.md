## Feature

Retrovirus

+dsDNA that is covalently closed and almost circular.
Reverse transcriptase.
Enveloped.

## Life cycle

Blood transmission from environment or other infected individual.
Can exist in the environment up to a week.
In endemic areas, delivery transmission is common.
Gets to the hepatic system, binds to bile acid receptors (NTCP and HSPG), and triggers endocytosis
Envelop fuses and the capsid is released into the cytosol and crawls on the microtubule to reach the nucleus.
Human immunodecifiency virus (similar RNA virus) also crawls on the microtubule to reach the nucleus.
Host DNA polymerase repairs the viral genome and make it circular.
This circular genome exists in the nucleus as a mini chromosome and can integrate.
Makes mRNAs and proteins.
And the mRNAs can reverse transcribes to the partially circular dsDNA.
Incubates for 2-5 months.

During the acute infection, it secretes incomplete proteins HBsAg and HBeAg to decoy and stress the immune system.
These viral particles build tolerance.
Antibodies against the surface, protein E, and the core are present.
Only the anti-surface is protective.
The newly made proteins and the dsDNA assemble new viruses, which exit without harming the host cell, exiting via bodily fluids to the environment.

Many acquired from parinatal transmission or during early childhood.
Sexually transmitted.

S {all surface things
Surface antigen is from aucte or chronic infection: anytime.
C {all core things
Anti core does not protect against infection

Sag and IgMc presnt = diagnosis of acute infecino

AntiE is not protective but alleviates.

Forming HbSAb protects!

## Disease

Treat by targetting the reverse transcriptase and giving interferon.

### Background

90% infants become chronically infected.
95% adults clear the infection, but the infection recurs when there is immunosupression.

Maternal vertical transmission.
3% humans currently infected.
1/3 population has been infected at some point.

High prevalence in the Middle East, Asia, and Africa.

Presence of hepatitis D virus worsens the symptoms.

## Disease

Acute Hepatitis

Chronic Hepatitis

Cirrhosis
(Leading cause of)

Hepatocellular Carcinoma
(Leading cause of; Without cirrhosis; )

## Risk Factor

Poor Hygiene

IV Drug Use

Homelessness

Man who Have Sex with Men

Anal Intercourse

Incarceration

### Sign and Symptom

Hepatomegaly

Splenomegaly

Juandice

Scleral Icterus

Nausea

### Diagnosis

E is cheaper and more than S.

Antigens:
E, S, and C are together.
E before S and both present for 4 weeks.
C is unmeasurable.

Antibodies:
Soon IgMc months later IgGc.
Months later IgGe and then even later IgGs.

Acute (less than 6 months): IgMc
Infectious: HBeAg
Chronic: Less IgMc and more IgGc

Naive: all -
Immunized (with the surface protein vaccine): IgGs+, IgGc-
Resolved: IgGs+, IgGc+

### Prevention

Surface antigen HbsAg vaccine recommended for all infants and non-immune individuals.

Screen pregnant women.
Newborn is not infected in utero but during birth; placenta shields.
If positive, treat the newborn with immunoglobulin at birth.

Post-exposure prophylaxis with vaccine and HBIg.

Treating a chronic infection requires antivirals and things to slow down the progression of liver damage.
