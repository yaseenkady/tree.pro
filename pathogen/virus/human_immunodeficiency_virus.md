## Summary

## Name

Used to be called human T lymphotropic virus 3.

## PATHOGEN

### Evolve

HIV1 is the predominant type, and HIV2 exists.

Lentivirus, which is retrovirus with long incubation time.
Contains: +ssRNA, reverse transcriptase, integrase, Tat, capsid, protease, matrix, membrane, gp41, and gp120.
Gag gene encodes for the internal core proteins including p24, which is less variable.
Env gene codes for gp41 and gp120, which is more variable.
Pol gene codes for reverse transcriptase, integrase, and protease.
RNA transcribed DNA, which integrates into the host genome.

Bar shaped capsid surrounded by an envelop.

### Enter

Microfold cell grabs them across the epithelium.

gp120 binds to the CD4.
CCR5 and CXCR4 also participate in the docking.
People with CCR5 variant can be resistant to the infection.

Infects first Langerhans cell, which is a specialized dendritic cell.
Langerhans cell spreads the virus to CD4+ T cells.
Proliferate in various cell types and blood.

### Colonize

### Persist

+ssRNA rapidly becomes protein.
Reverse transcriptase converts the RNA into DNA.
Integrase integrates the DNA into the host genome.
Tat gene product inactivates MHC1.
Protease processes viral proteins for assembly.
Membrane is that of the host cell.
gp120 combine and bind to CD4 receptor.
gp41 induces fusion entry.

### Replicate

Mutates frequently.

### Exit

Sexual transmission.
Placenta transmission.
Breast milk transmission.
Transmitted like hepatitis B virus, but less efficiently.

## IMMUNITY

### Protect

### Detect

### Deploy

### Eliminate

### Remember

## MEDICINE

### Sign and Symptom

Incubates for weeks.
Acute phase 2-4 weeks after the infection: rapid increase in the virus and decrease in CD4 cells, followed by the immune system fighting aginst the viruses and reversing the trends, almost recovering to the normal range; mono-like symptoms (fever, myalgia, malaise, pharyngitis, lymphadenopathy, generalized [nonspecific] maculopapular rash).
Latent phase for 7 to 11 years: loss of CD4 cells results in gradual weakening of the immune system.
Late latent phase results in AIDS, which is having less than 200 CD4+ T cells.
Can result in cancers: Kaposi sarcoma, cervical cancer, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and CNS lymphoma.
Sexually transmitted.

CD4

Below 400
Candida albicans causes thrush, varicella zoster virus causes rash, Mycobacterium tuberculosis causes tuberculosis

Below 200 (AIDS)
Pneumocystis jiroveci (fungus) (sputum) causes pneumonia (subacute dry cough with hypoxia).
Kaposi sarcoma causes sarcoma.
Herpes virus causes ulcers.
Cryposporidium (protozoa) (acid fast), Microsporidium, and Isospora cause diarrhea.
Epstein Bar virus causes non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

Below 100
Candida esophagitis (yeast, fluconazole)
Toxoplasmosis (protozoa, brain, sulfadiazine + pyrimethamine)
Histoplasmosis (dimorphic mold, itraconazole)
Coccidioidomycosis

Below 50
CMV retinitis
Mycobacterium avium (azithromycin, rifampin, and ethambutol)
Cryptococcal neoformans (yeast) causes meningitis (amphotericin and flucytosisne)
Epstein Bar virus causes CNS lymphoma.

JC virus causing progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy.
HPV causes cervical cancer.

### Diagnosis

Can't diagnose infants (younger than 18 month old) by Ig because they get Igs from the mother.

The initial test is ELISA for p24, a capsid protein.
The confirmatory test is Western blod for p24.
False negative antibody test in the first 3 weeks; Use HIV PCR test.

PCR test.
Antibody test.

For testing an asymptomatic case, test p24 antigen and antibody.

### Therapy

Antiviral combination therapy.
Early intervention and adherence increase the efficacy.

Viral load to quantify.

### Prevention

Increase testing.

### Epidemiology

1981, young gay men were dying of pneumonia.

More than 60 million people have been infected.
Over 50% mortality.

Drug use.
Sexual worker.
Men to have sex with men.
