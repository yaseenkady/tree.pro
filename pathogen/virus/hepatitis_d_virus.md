-ssRNA.
Hepatitis D virus infection requires hepatitis B virus co-infection, specifically the envelop.
Circular genome codes for a single RNA with 1 protein, the capsid, in tandem, whose amino acid is segmented into multiple proteins.
Lacks RNA-dependent RNA polymerase; may use the host's DNA-dependent RNA polymerase.

Blood transmitted.
Using the same envelop as hepatitis B virus enables binding to the bile acid receptors and enter into hepatocytes.
Capsid behaves like that of hepatitis B virus and travels to the nucleus.
Unlike other RNA viruses, RNA replication takes place in the nucleus.
Other such outlier RNA viruses include the retroviruses and the influenza virus.
Mutates frequently.

Often, chronically infects the liver.

Accelerates the prerequisite hepatitis B virus infection and is thus the most severe form of chronic viral hepatitis with the fastest progression to cirrhosis, 10% by 5 years and 80% in 30 years.

Acute super infection (mortality up to 15%) of a chronic hepatitis B virus carrier results in severe acute hepatitis followed by chronic hepatitis in 90%.

Some places screen all hepatitis B virus infected people with hepatitis D virus.
Active infection is detected with PCR.
Presence of antibodies is a sign of previous infection.

Prevalent in Mongolia, North and West Africa Eastern Europe.

Prevent hepatitis B viral infection.
Sexually transmitted.
