Sheep and other cattle livers contain cycsts, which contain many tapeworm heads.

These animals are the intermediate hosts.

When dogs eat uncooked and infected intermediate hosts, the cysts hatch the heads when passing through the dog stomach.

In the dog intestine, the heads mature and lay eggs.

Dogs are the definitive host.

Humans are also intermediate hosts.

When humans eat the eggs, humans become the sheep, where the cysts disseminate via the portal circulation to the liver and other organs.

Most infection is asymptomatic.

But the cysts can damage end organs by mass effect.

Cysts can hatch and cause eosinophilic reaction.

Puncture and treat with antihelminthic, because the cysts are protected from the circulation.
