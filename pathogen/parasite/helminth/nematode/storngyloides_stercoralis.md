# .

Fecal- or soil-skin transmission.

Penetrates the skin and burrows into the circulation and develops in the lung.

Is then coughed up and swallowed to reach the small intestine.

Larva matures there and lays eggs in the small intestinal wall.

Eggs hatch and the baby worms travel to the anus as they mature.

The worms can reenter from the rectal mucosa or infect other people.

Eosinophilic reaction.

Most infection is asymptomatic.

Treat with ivermectin or albendazole.

In people with immunodeficiency, without enough eosinophils, hyperinfection spreads the worms and bacteria systemically causing sepsis.

Treat hyperinfection with ivermectin, antibiotics, and reverse immunosupression.
