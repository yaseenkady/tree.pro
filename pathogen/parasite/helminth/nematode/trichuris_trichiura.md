Whipworm.

Fecal-soil-oral transmission.

Eggs look like football.

Eggs hatch as they pass the stomach and the worms mature in the large intestine.

The worm heads burrow into the epithelium whle the sexual organs stay in the intestinal lumen, laying eggs.

The eggs exit via feces and embronates in the soil over month to become infectious.

Every female lays thousands of eggs daily.

Adult worms live for 3 years.

Most infection is asymptomatic.

The heads serve as antigens, but there is only little.

The body is not able to clear the infection by itself.

Eggs may treat inflammatory bowel disease.

Treat with albendazole or mebendazole.

Reinfection is common.
