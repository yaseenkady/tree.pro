Amoeba means to change.

Anearobe.
Contains many values containing difestive chemicals.

Some other Entamoeba are commensal in the gastrointestinal tract.

Fecal-oral transmission of resistant cysts (resists stomach acid).
Bile acid stimulates the digesting of the cyst wall from within, and a trophozoite emerges.
Trophozoites degrades the mucus layer with proteases and comes in contact with the enterocytes.
Trophozoites colonize colon, eating bacteria and dead epithelial cells.
Eats epithelial cells and inflames the local tissue.
Invades deeper and eats red blood cells (other commensal amoeba do not).
Subacute onset 1-3 weeks.
Spreads via portal circulation to liver.

Stool microscopy, rapid antigen test, and PCR.
Differentiate other bacterial inflammatory diarrhea.

Metronidazole targets the trophozoites and paromomycin targets the cysts (aminoglycoside protein systhesis inhibitor).

Endemic in Africa, South America, Mexico, and Asia.
Affects children more.
10% people is infected.
90% is asymptomatic.
2nd leading cause of death from parasites.
