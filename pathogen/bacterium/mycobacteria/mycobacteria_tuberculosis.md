## Epidemiology

Koch discovered the pathogen to cause wasting tuberculosis in 1882.

## Feature

First branch out of the Gram+ phylogenetic gree.

Gram+ with thinner peptidoglycan surrounded by arabinogalactan layer that extends various lipids including mycolic acid, which is a long fatty acid of arabinogalactan.
Resistant to drying and chemical disinfectants.
Lipid proteins extend from the cytosol to the outer lipid layer.
Less permeable so uses pores to transport things.
Not stainable with Gram staining but other lipid soluble stains including carbol fuchsin.
Stain with carbol fuchsin and then wash away with acid or alcohol; the entire process is called acid fast staining.

30-60% dry weight is lipid.
33% genome is for working with lipids.

Lipids are the virulent factors.

- Stimulate granuloma formation
- Evade immune recognition
- Prevent phagosome maturation
- Inhibit dendritic cell maturation and T cell activation; significantly delays the process

Aerobic nonmotile rod.

## Life

Human specific and humans are the reserviors.

Transmits via air droplets, which are 1-5um in diameter (liquid evaporates leaving dry bacteria which resists drying and floats in the air for 6 huors.)

Alveolar macrophage eats it.
Dormant for years.

Calcified granuloma indicates all bacteria are killed.

Cavities made by spilled lytic things make a good aerobic space for replication.

### Persist

Prevents endosome from fusing to lysosome, preventing monocyte maturation.
Grows within macrophage endosome.
Good immunity can't get rid of it and results in a stalemate forming granuloma (many immune cells surround the infection).
Dormant for years.

Peptidoglycan + Arabinogalactan that is covalently linked with mycolic acid + Lipotechnoic acid

Release lysosome contents to cause local damage.

Many die in a granuloma but some survive.

### Replicate

There is less ribosome and permeability and divides slowly, every 20 hours.

### Exit

When immunity weakens (or in 10% of infected people), it spreads from the granuloma, which becomes a cavity.

Infected macrophage summons immune cells and die, releasing lysosomal chemicals and bacteria.

## IMMUNITY

### Protect

### Detect

### Deploy

Macrophage.
T cell arrive (late) and instruct macrophages to kill the bacteria, but not all die.

### Eliminate

### Remember

## MEDICINE

### Sign and Symptom

Diabetes and TNFa supression are risk factors of granuloma disruption and disease progression.

Used to be called consumption (white plague).

The primary infection is the latent infection which is contained by normal immune response.

10% of the primary infection progresses; 90% latent and is not contagious.
50% of the progressed disease becomes pulmonary in 2 years and the other 50% becomes extra-pulmonary in life time.

Asymptomatic during the primary infection where it spreads to various organs including bone, meninges, vertebral bodies, brain, kidney, and the reproductive organs.

Low grade fever.

Cough.
Hemoptisis.

Pneumonia, commonly in the upper lobe.

- Constitutional symptoms
- Pneumonia with miliary pattern opacity; hemoptisis.
- Lymphoadenopathy
- Meningitis (hydrocephalus).
- Central nervous system infection

Bronchial and laryngeal lesions are rare.

The most common extra-pulmonary sign is lymphadenitis.

### Diagnosis

Latent:
Tuberculin skin test; history of vaccination (which is made of Mycobecteria bovis) or exposure to other Mycobacteria results in positive result.
Higher the risk of progression, lower the positive threshold (15, 10, and 5mm).
Interferon gamma release assay.
These measure the immune response to the infection so false negative if testing too early (it takes 3-9 weeks for the T cell response).
Can not distinguish latent and progressing.

Image if positive.
May or may not upper airway cavity (there is more O2).

Progressed disease:
Culture and or PCR fluids.
Acid fast staining of mycolic acid with carbol fuchsin.
Hilar lymphadenopathy.
Lung x-ray shows miliary pattern opacities, which suggests a systemic bacterial spread.

Biopsy.

### Therapy

Sanatorium (fresh air, UV, high altitutde, hiking path chair).
Tried various therapies cod oil and artificial pneumothorax, until 1940s streptomycin.

Treat the latent infection (single antibacterial) to reduce the reservior.
Treat the progressing infection (combination antibacterial) to avoid death.

Mutation rather than horizontal gene transfer confers resistance.

Latent infection has 1000s of bacteria but progressing one has much more, and thus more mutant and resistant ones.
This is why multiple antibacterials are used together.

(Liver toxicity.)
Isoniazid inhibits the enzyme that makes mycolic acid; used for both latent and progressing.
(Lipophilic and diffuses into cells.)

Pyrazinamide inhibits plasma membrane or arabinogalactan (for progressing tuberculosis disease).
Ethambutol inhibits arabinogalactan polymerization; causes optic neuritis (added to support isoniazid resistant cases in progressing disease).

Rifampin is lipophilic and inhibits RNA polymerase; used for both latent and progressing.
(Drug-drug interaction is a concern.)

Latent: isoniazid for 9 months.
Progressing pulmonary disease: the 4 drugs for 2 months followed by 2 drugs (isoniazid and rifampin) for 4 months.
Progressing extrapulmonary disease: longer.

### Prevention

BCG vaccine, which leavs a characteristic scar.
Effective in children.
Does not prevent Mycobacteria tuberculosis infection.
Prevents 5% of TB related deaths.
Not standardized.

Slow disease with low treatment adherence makes it difficult to eradiacate.
Affects poor disproportionally.
Public health measures including contact tracing and annual testing.

1/4 of HIV related dealth is tuberculosis, the lead HIV patient killer.
Synergizes with HIV (both diseases progress and associated with multidrug resistance).

Multidrug resistanat ones are dangerous and need severer and longer treatment.

UV.

### Epidemiology

Killed more humans than any other pathogen.
White plague.

Infect 1/3 population.
Kills more people than other pathogens.
95% of deaths are in poor places.
