## Name

Myco refers to the fungal like growth of some Mycoplasma species.

## Feature

Looks like a bowling pin.
Head is the narrow end.

Evolved from Gram+.

Smallest self-replicating organisms.
0.1-0.2um wide and 1-2um long.

Lacks peptidoglycan, an important structural support.
Requires sterol and is the only bacteria that uses cholesterol, which is from the host cell.
Depends on the host cell biosynthesis of cholesterol and nutrients.

Unlike other bacteria, UGA codon is not a stop codon but translates into tryptophan.

Lacks many metabolic pathways.
Devotes to establishing H gradient and maintianing organelle that attaches to the host cell and glides the body.

Difficult to culture; not done in clinical setting.
Fried egg appearance in culture.

Makes community acquired respiratory distress syndrome toxin, which paralyzes cilia and kills the neighboring host cells, which are shed.

Makes H2O2.

## Life

Mycoplasma species infect mucosal tracts such as respiratory and urogenital.
Myucoplasma pneumonia infects the respiratory epithelial cells.

Orients parallel to cilia and inserts itself inbetween cilia and uses P1 protein to attach to a surface protein at the base of cilia.

Enters respiratory epithelial cell.

Incubates for 2-3 weeks.

Replicates in the cytosol.

Exit by lyses the host cell.

Activates various immune cells with its toxin.

Avoids immunity by living in cells, using host like membranes, and decoying immune cells.

## Immunity

Incomplete, resulting in reinfection.

## Epidemiology

Common in 5-20 years old.

Outbreak is common in the late summer and fall.
Epidemic every 3-7 years.

## Medicine

Radiograph shows bilateral patchy, reticular, fine opacities.

Test with serum cold agglutination.
Confirm with PCR.

Most infection is mild and self limited.

There is no cell wall so no cell wall inhibitors work.
Erythromycin, azithromycin, or clarithromycin.
Tetracyclines.
