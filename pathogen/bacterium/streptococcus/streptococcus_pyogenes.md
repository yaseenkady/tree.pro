## Name

Streptos means chain.
Coccos means berry.
Pyo means pus.
Genes means making.

## Feature

Diplococcus.
Chain is longer than Streptococcus pneumonia.

Group A Streptococcus.
Becitracin sensitive.

## Life

Nasopharynx.
Mucosal associated lymphoid tissue.
Gastrointestinal tract and lower female genital tract.
Oropharynx.
Tonsils.
Genital mucosa.
Rectum.
Lives extracellularly.
Attaches with pili.

Many serotypes.
Like lymphatic tissues including Walldeyer's Ring.

Nasopharynx has good ventilation and blood and less anaerobic competitors.

Single axis replication results in a chain.

This remarkable microbe could provide a Master class to other bacteria on how to evade host complement deposition and activation, impede phagocyte recruitment and activation, resist killing by host antimicrobial peptides and reactive oxygen species, escape the DNA nets thrown out by neutrophils, and kill phagocytic host cells by punching holes in their cytoplasmic membrane.

Makes a lot of weapons.

M protein (most important virulence factor) inhibits the complement system and thus phagocytosis; autoimmunity; 100 types; binds factor H on the surface of the bacteria and fibrinogen, which repels C3b.
C5 peptidase; determines type specific immunity.

Capsule made of hyaluronate, which mimics the hyaluronate in the connective tissues; also antiphagocytic; determines virulence; hyaluronate binds to CD44 on epithelial cells; CD44 is for intercellular bridging; CD44 increases after injury.
Lipoteichoic acid, resists antimicrobial peptdes and neutrophil killing.

Erythrogenic toxins including streptolysin O (O2 inactivates it) damages the red blood cells and white blood cells.

Streptolysin O: responsible for b hemolysis; sends in NADase via the pore; oxygen killed hemolytic exotoxin; works with NADase; resist phagosome acidification and NADase moves from the phagolysosome to cytosol and destroys NAD and depletes energies; toxic to various cell types including myocardium.
Streptolysin S: oxygen not-killed lytic exotoxin againt broad targets including erythrocytes, leukocytes, platelets, and organalles including lysocomes and mitochondria.
Catalase-negative (unlike many other organisms).

Streptococcal pyrogenic exotocin A and C: encoded by bacteriophage; superantigens ==> nonspecifically activate immune cells; rash, scarlet fever, nectotizing fasciitis, ~toxic shock syndrome.
Streptococcal pyrogenic exotocin B: degrade extracellular matrix, cytokines, compliment proteins, antibodies.

Hyaluronidase degrades (Staphylococcus aureus has it too) hyaluronic acid in connective tissue.
DNAase.
Streptokinase (Staphylococcus aureus has Staphylokinase which activates plasmin which digests fibrin clots and degrades C3b and IgG opsonins).

## Therapy

Penicillin, amoxicillin,

Surgery.

## Epidemiology

Rheumatic fever is rare in developed countries but the most common cause of chronic heart disease called rhuematic heart disease in the developing countries.
Rheumatic fever 50% of the time results in joint symptoms and 30% Syndenham chorea.

## Immunity

Antibody against M protein.
M protein mimics host protein, and the antibodies can be autoimmune.

Antibody against streptolysin O.

Antibody mediated phagocytosis.

### Diagnosis

Viral features should be absent: rhinorrhea, cough, oral olcer, conjunctivis, and horseness.

Throat culture rapid antigen detection test.
In children, negative rapid antigen detection test (specific but not sensitive) should be confirmed by throat culture.

Diagnose acute rheumatic fever based on the Jones criteria.

Anti Streptolysin O titer indicates recent infection, but is not commonly done.

Streptococcal Pharyngitis
(Common in 5-15 years old but viral pharyngitis is still the most common.)

Scarlet Fever
(Associated with Streptococcal pharyngitis; fever, pharyngitis, and erythematous rash)

Strawberry Tongue

Circumoral Pallor

Acute Rheumatic Fever
(Associated with Streptococcal pharyngitis; common in 5-15 yeals old; autoimmunity from the antibodies against the M protein)

Post Streptococcal Glomerulonephritis
(Associated with Streptococcal pharyngitis; 1-2 weeks after the infection; common in children; self limited)

Rheumatic Heart Disease
(5% of acute rheumatic fever; Presents 10-20 years after the infection; pancarditis, pericardial friction, Aschoff body made of multinucleated giant cells in all layers; In the developing countries, the most common cause of chronic heart disease)

Sydenham Chorea
(30% of acute rheumatic fever; From the antibody effect on the basal ganglia)
