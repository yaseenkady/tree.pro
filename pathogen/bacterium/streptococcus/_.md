Streptococcus species are classified based on their hemolytic properties and then surface glycoproteins.

A hemolysis converts Fe2+ to Fe3+, breaking hemoglobin into biliverdin; results in a green colony on a blood agar.
B hemolysis uses streptolysin to destroy red blood cells; results in a clear area on a blood agar.
G hemolysis can not do hemolysis.

B hemolysis is further classified based on their surface glycoproteins by Lancefield.

Streptococcus pneumonia is a hemolytic.
Streptococcus pyogenes is b hemolytic group A.
Streptococcus agalactia is b hemolytic group B.

Most are oxidase negative and catalase negative, and many are facultative anaerobes.
Oxidase test checks for cytochrome C oxidases O2 energy production.
