## Name

Strepto means chain.
Pneumonia means lung inflammation.

## Feature

Spherical.
Diplococcus or short chain.

Gram+.

Lipoteichoic acid with phosphor-choline, which serves as a versatile binder for human and pneumococcal proteins.

Capsule inhibits the complement system and is the major virulence factor.
90+ serotypes based on the capsule glycoproteins, but the C polysaccharide present on all capsules is used for the antigen test.

No Lancefield surface antigens.

Pili for attachment.
Choline binding protein (unique to this microbe) binds to receptor for platelet-activating factor.
Pneumococcal surface protein A inhibits complement deposition and activation, binds lactoferrin, and interferes with phagocytes.

Sensitive to bile acid.

Nonmotle.

Facultative anaerobe.
Requires choline.

A hemolytic.
IgAse.
Neuraminidase, which synergizes with influenza virus and parainfluenza virus.
Pneumolysin forms pore.

Good at DNA repair and exchange with transformation, which occurs more under stress.

Optochin sensitive.
Quellung positive.

## Life

Commensal in the upper respiratory track.
Compete with Haemophilus influenza, which occupies the same niche.
Both have capsule and recruite granulocytes, burst them and damage the local things, and repair faster than others to out compete them.

In the nose, transparent phase.
In the blood, opaque phase, which is sticker and has more capsule and polysaccharides.

Synergize after influenza virus infection.

## Epidemiology

Children transmit frequently.

More prevelant in the fall and winter.

Cephalosporin and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae is becoming common.

Used in the experiment to show that DNA is the inheritance molecule.

## Medicine

People with lung abnormalities and immunocompromise are more susceptible.

Cochlear implant is a risk factor.

Single acute rigor.
The typical community acquired bacterial pneumonia, with lobar consolidation.

Clinical diagnosis confirmed with a culture.

Outpatient with health: macrolides (azithromycin, clarithromycin, or erythromycin) or doxycycline.

Outpatient with co-morbidity: fluoroquinolone (moxifloxacin, gatifloxacin, lenofloxacin) or or b lactam (amoxicillin) plus macrolide.

Scheduled vaccine for <2 and 65<=.
Prevnar 13 vaccine contains 13 serotypes of pneumococcus conjugated to diphtheria carrier protein.
23 serotype one is newly available.
Serotype not included in the vaccine is becoming more common.

Meningitis has 20% mortality rate.
