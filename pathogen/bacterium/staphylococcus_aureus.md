Staphylococcus means grapes.
Aureus means golden.

It forms golden colonies, and Staphylococcus epidermis forms white colonies.

It is a Gram+ bacteria that lives on moist keratinized epithelium found in 30% of people's skins, upper respiratory tract, and lower reproductive tract.
Methicillin resistant type is found in 2% of people.

20% of its genome is dynamic, being transferred by bacteriophages and other mechanisms to others.
So, each bacterium is vastly different from another and a population heterogeneous.
Heterogeneous individuals simultaneously infect and cause diseases.

It can not travel, but can attach to peptidoglycan, which is common in collagen, fibrinogen, and elastin.
It homes on heart valves, within clots, and in various places.

It walls itself with biofilm.
The biofilm often contains fungus Candida albicans.
It also has coagulase, which activates fibrinogen into fibrin to form thrombotic walls.

It has multiple adhesins and microscopically damaged surfaces are prone to be infected.

It can make energy by oxidation or fermentation.

It forms an abcess with neutrophils.
Its golden color is from the carotenoid pigmnet (which makes carrots red) Staphyloxanthin, which resists oxidation.
Its catalaze disables oxidizing H2O2 into H2O and O2.
Its protein A binds to the antibody FC regions to inhibit opsonization.

Its toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 nonspecifically links the T cell receptors with MHC2s, over activating the immune system.
Overreactive immune system results in an inadequate immunity against it.

Its enterotoxin causes food poisoning.

Its exofoliative toxin breaks epidermis to help spreading.
Its hyaluronidase breaks down hyaluronic acid found in connective tissues.
Its hemolysins can completely lyses red blood cells (making it being classified as a G or B hemolytic microbe).
Its leukocidin also makes pore.
Its DNAse breaks down the neutrophil DNA traps.
It also has lipases, phospholipases, and proteases.

It has glucocorticoid receptors.

Its diagnosed by blood or stool culture.
Its culture should be Gram+, grape like, catalase+, coagulase+, and DNAse+.

Iron sequestration.

It is used to be treated with simpler cell wall inhibitors (B lactams) such as penicillin, which inhibits PBP.
But some acquired penicillnase, which inactivates penicillin.

Penicillnase-resistant cell wall inhibitors like nafcillin (the most specific treatment against it) were developed and are used today.

But then B lactam resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) emerged.
MRSA has mecA gene that makes PBP2a, which binds less with B lactams.
mecA is on a mobile genomic sequence that can be transferred to others.
Methicillin is an old B lactam that used to be used clinically but now it is used only to test for this resistance.
For treating MRSA, vancomycin, which disrupts D-Alanine-D-Alanine crosslinking in the cell wall synthesis, is used.

However, recently, some acquired the ability to crosslink with D-Alanine-D-Lactate, which escapes binding to vancomycin.

Bacteriophages against it are being devleoped.

There is no vaccine.
Implants should be monitored for infection.

Rash is localized.
