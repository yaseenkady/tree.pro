Named after pediatrician Escherich and colon.

Gram- rod.
Commensal in the gastrointestinal tract.
Horizontal gene transfer.
Lipopolysaccharide.

Exfoliating toxin.
B lactamase.

Intestianl and extraintestinal presentation.

Fecal-oral transmission.

## Enterotoxigenic:

From plasmid, got pili and 2 toxins that leak Cl- out of the cell from the CFTR.
Labile toxin (LT) is similr to cholera AB toxin.
Stable toxin (ST) is a small peptide; heat denatures it but it refolds when cooling and remain toxic.

With rotavirus, causes most of the diarrheal illness in children.

Traveler's diarrhea.

Infects the proximal small intestine.

Fecal-oral transmission?

Diarrhea.Watery

## Enteropathogenic:

Pili.
Pathogenicity island codes for type 3 secretion system, which inserts into a enterocyte to create a channel.
Through the channel, proteins move into the cell and remodel the cytoplasm to build a docking site and damage the tight junction.

Infects the proximal small intestine.
Commonly cause long duration diarrhea in infants.

Fecal-oral transmission?

Diarrhea.Watery

## Shiga-toxigenic or enterohemorrhagic:

Commensal in cattles.

Bacteriophage infected animal enteropathogenic Escherichia coli and gave it the gene for Shiga toxin, an AB toxin like in Vibrio cholera.
The shiga A subunit can insert the shiga B subunit and the type 3 secretion system can also inject the shiga B subunit.

Infects the distal small intestine and colon.
Incubates for 2-5 days.

Shiga subunit A shuts down ribosome causing apoptosis.
Shiga subunit B destroys cells.
Together they can affect cells of glomerulus, colon, cerebral epithelium, microvascular endothelium, monocytes, and platelets.
Microangiopathy results inflammation, thrombosis, and ischemia.

Watery diarrhea plus inflammation results in bloody diarrhea.

Self limited.
Supportive care such as volume expansion, transfusion, and dialysis until the toxin fades away.
Antibiotics can be harmful because stressing the bacteria signals the bacteriophage genome to make more virus and exit the bacteria.
Because the gene for shiga toxin is near viral genes, making more bacteriophage results in making more shiga toxins.

Source is contaminated food.
Does not spread from human to human like enterotoxigenic and enteropathogenic Escherichia coli.

Abdominal Pain

Diarrhea.Watery

Diarrhea.Bloody

Thrombocytopenia

Thrombotic Microangiopathy

Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome
(5-10% cases)

## Uro-pathogenic:

Gastrointestinal to urinary tract infection.
More common in females because of their shorter urethra.
Urinary flow clears them.
Anatomic abnormalities and sexual intercourse (honeymoon cystitis) are risk factors.

Pili (fimbria) attach to the urinary tract epithelial cells.

Attachment results in getting inside the cell.

Replicates intracellularly and rapidly, bulging and bursting the infected cell.
Some may hide intracellularly and dormantly and result in a recurrent infection.

Urinary tract abnormalities are risk fasctors for recurrent infection.

Structural abnormalities are risk fasctors for recurrent infectionl

Seminal tract infection is possible too.

Neutrophils come and infected cells come off.
Urine analysis: hazy (cells and debris), blood (inflammation), nitrite (bacteria metabolite), leukocyte esterase (while blood cell especially neutrophil protein), white blood cells, and bacteria.
Periurethral flora can infect the meauring instrument and cause false positive (asymptomatic bacteriuria).

Empirical treatment (only if symptomatic):

- Amoxicillin (old practice)
- Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (increasing resistance)
- Nitrofurantoin
- Phosphomycin
- Ciprofloxacin (increasing resistance)
- B lactams
