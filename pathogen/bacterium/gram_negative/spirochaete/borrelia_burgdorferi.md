Borrelia burgdorferi (Beri) is a tick-borne spiral bacteria that causes Lyme disease, which is a collection of local and systemic problems.

"Borrel" is the scientist who studied spiral bacteria.
"Burgdorfer" is the scientist who isolated Beri in 1982.

Beri is endemic in the North-East US and is also found in Europe and Asia.
It is the most common vector-borne infectious agent in the US, with over 30,000 cases per year.

Most of Beri are in white-footed mice and deer.
Heavy-bodied and black-legged ticks called Ixodes scapularis bite on these animals and spread Beri to others including human.
Young ticks mostly bite on mice (which have thinner skin) and adult ticks deers.

When a tick bites on an infected animal, Beri enters the ticks stomach.
Later, when this tick bites a person, Beri within the stomach senses the person's blood and travels to the tick salivary gland.
As the tick continuously injects saliva, which numbs its bite, Beri enters the person.
Overall, it takes 2 to 3 days from sensing the blood to entering the person.

In the person, Beri replicates slowly, doubling every 24 to 48 hours.
Using its internal flagella, Beri burrows inbetween cells to spread (it does not spread to other person).
Beri supresses immune cells and immune proteins (the complement system).
Furthermore, Beri frequently changes its outer membrane protein (Osp) to avoid being recognized by the immune system.

As Beri spread, their tracts disrupt cells, causing Lyme disease, which has 3 stages.

3 to 30 days after the bite, the early localized stage happens.
The site of the bite develops a rash called `erythema migrans`.
The person develops `flu-like symptoms`.

If the person is not treated promptly, weeks to months later, Beri reaches muscles, joints, heart, and the nervous system.
This is the early disseminated stage.
The person develops multiple `rash`es, `myopathy`, neurologic symptoms including `lymphocytic meningitis` and `cranial nerve palsy` (typically VII), and cardiac symptoms including `3rd degree atrioventricular block` and `myocarditis`.

Months to year later, the late stage happens.
The person develops `infective arthritis` of large joints, `chronic encephalomyelitis`, `polyneuropathy`, `mononeuritis multiplex`, and `neuropsychiatric syndrome`.

If the treatment is delayed, even with a successful treatment, sometimes the person develops `post-Lyme disease syndrome`, which is a collection of non-specific symptoms including `headache` and `fatigue`.

After an infection, the person's antibodies last for a long time and prevent future Beri infection.

Finally, the ticks carry other pathogens including Babesia.
10% of Beri infection also comes with Babesia coinfection.

Prevent Beri infection by: avoiding infested areas; wearing protective clothes; using tick repellants; remove ticks early without squeezing; and bathing after any potential exposure.
