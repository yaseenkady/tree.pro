Gram- coccobacillus.

Other Yersinia species are gut microbes but Yersinia pestis is the only one that can survive in an insect and extracellularly in blood.

Rodents are the reservoir host.

Rodent-flea-skin transmission.

Within flea pharynx, where the temperature is low, it forms biofilm to survive and stimnulate the flea to bite animals, fascilitating transmission.

Also transmits rarely by secretions and aerosolized droplets, which lead the pneumonic plague, the Plague which killed 1/3 of European population.

Within human, where the temperature is high, it dissolves the biofilm.

Type 3 secretion system blocks phagocytosis, but some macrophages can carry it to the lymphnodes, where it proliferates.

Extends into blood stream and causes sepsis that is often fatal.

Fleas tend to feed repeatedly on one host, so this bacteria wants to kill the host to spread to other hosts.

Bacteremia in the blood causes sepsis, making it easier for flea to reuptake it, and rapidly kills the host, making flea to get to another indvidual.

Vaccine is available but its efficacy is unknown.

Lipopolysaccharide, as in other Gram-.

Rapid antibiotics, like gentamicin, tetracycline, and doxycycline, save lives.
