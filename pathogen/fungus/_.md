Cell + wall - cholesterol + ergosterol + melanin + capsule.
Wall is different from those of bacterium or plant, made of chitin, b glucans, and galactomannans (the latter 2 are used for diagnosing infection).
Melanin protects itself from UV and oxidation by phagocytes.

Move by diffusion.

Lives intracellularly.
Can't photosynthesis or make its own energy so it must eat.

Uni-cellular is yeast.
Multi-cellular is mold.
Temperature changes forms between yeast which prefers higher temperature and mold which prefers lower temperature.
Pseudohyphae is hyphae made of chained yeasts.

500 fungi can cause diseases in immunocompromised humans.
100 fungi can cause diseases in immunocompetent humans.

Human body temperature is too high for most fungi to survive.
Allergen.
Small number of fungi are pathogenic and results in mycosis.

Can't transmit between human.

Distinguish between fungi by comparing their reproductive structures, which manifest only outside of the human body.

Treatment targets:

- Ergosterol, synthesis and function
- Wall, b glucan
- Nucleic acid synthesis

Endemic fungi are not transmitted between people.
