## Name

Candida means white.
Albicans means to be white.

##

Lives on mucosa in a biofilm, which is resistant to antifungal molecules, community existing in both yeast and hyphal forms.

Exist as 2 forms simultaneously.
Yeast land and attach.
Hyphae grow and support.

Also using host things, makes the covering matrix.

Commensal in gastrointestinal, respiratory, and skin mucosa.
Commensal also in other mammals and insects.
Some Candida species use non-standard translation, where CUG translates to not leucine but serine.

Infects opportunistically when immunity or barrier is weak:

- New borns, who have less developed T helper cells
- Peole on antibiotics, who have less bacteria to compete against fungus
- People at certain menstural phase or menopause, hormonal states advantageous for fungal infection
- Diabetics
- People on chemotherapy, with AIDS, or in any immunocompromised state

Prefers moist mucosa like diaper rash.
Invades into the epithelium, can't be scraped off.

Penetrates mucosa.
Capsule inhibits angifungals.

Hematogeneous spread.

Drying skin.
Intact mucosal membrane.

### Sign and Symptom

Tongue thrush.
Diaper rash.
Systemic spread can result in abscesses, thrombothlebitis, endocarditis, eye infection, or infection of other soft tissues.

Risk factors: immunosupression, catheter, or gastrointestinal wall break.

Chronic mucocutaneous cadidiasis in patients with defective T helper cells.

Painful mucosal lesion.

Central coalescing lesion and peripheral satellite lesions.

### Diagnosis

Repeated blood sampling.

Culture is often positive because many Candida are commensal.
Serology tests for disseminating Candida.

KOH dissolves the non-yeast cells and reveal them.

Normal person can have positive culture too because of the commensal nature.

For urinary tract infection, the urine test can be false positive.

### Therapy

Antifungal.
Nystatin suspensions.
Topical azoles including clotrimazole.
Oral fluconazole.

Candidemia.
For deeper and systemic infections, use echinocandins or amphotericin B.
Find the source of the infection.
Endophthalmitis.
Meningitis is possible but the central nervous system infection is not common, unless there is a blood brain barrier disruption.

Urinary tract infection from external or blood.

In neutropenic patients, hepato-splenic candidiasis can happen together with low grade candidemia.

### Epidemiology

The most common fungal infection in the world.
Infects 90,000 people a year in the US.
25% population is colonized.
